Guóxìng Theater (國興戲院) was the very last standalone movie theater operating in Miaoli , Taiwan . After 70 years in the cinema business it closed for renovations in the final days of 2019, never to reopen. Apparently the intention was to return sometime after the Lunar New Year break in early 2020, but then the pandemic struck. Three years later it is probably safe to assume it’ll never show another film, marking an end to an era of independent cinema in Miaoli . View Image Details The last vintage theater in Miaoli in the long shadows of late afternoon. Originally established as Guójì Theater (國際戲院, literally “International Theater”) around 1950 1 , it faced strong competition from the eponymous Miaoli Theater in the bustling years of the Taiwan Economic Miracle . The popularization of public television, home video, and the modern cineplex eroded patronage into the 1990s, but Guoji Theater (as it was still known) persevered into the new century. The owner bought out the competition in the early 2000s 2 , shutting them all down not long thereafter, making Guoxing the only theater still screening films in the city. With the closure of Dōngshēng Theater (東聲戲院) in nearby Toufen in 2018 3 , Guoxing also became the last in the county for a brief span of time. View Image Details A colorful yet mutilated signboard spans the entrance to Guoxing Theater, which is located down a small laneway. I was fortunate to visit Guoxing Theater in October 2019, mere months before its final screening. I swung by on three occasion to capture the photos seen in this post, and had a brief chat with someone who might have been the manager (or even new owner). I was informed this theater was initially a rice mill (hence the peculiar dimensions of the theater, which is shaped somewhat like a trapezoid ), and later a stage for Hakka opera ( 客家大戲 ) before it was converted into a full-time cinema. The name was altered sometime in the 2000s, partly due to a change in ownership 4 , but also to improve its fortunes 5 . If you look closely at most of the photos in this report you’ll notice the second character on the facade has a slightly different sheen, and evidence of this renaming is obvious on the signboard over the alleyway leading to the theater.

Fast forward to 2023, and several of these posters remain entombed in the glass display cases on either side of the entrance, now faded to a wispy blue with exposure to the harsh subtropical sun. News reports of the closure 6 featured a fateful sign displayed out front reading “interior renovations” (整修內部) and “temporary suspension of business” (暫停營業), the very same wording featured in the closing minutes of Tsai Ming-liang ’s lyrical tribute to the dying days of cinema, Goodbye, Dragon Inn . View Image Details Guoxing Theater advertising at the site of a long-vanished cinema in nearby Gongguan. I’ll leave you with one more observation: whoever managed Guoxing Theater made extensive use of physical advertising around town 7 , especially at the sites of former cinemas. Miaoli Theater , now a veterinarian clinic and pet supplies shop, has an advertising board from Guoji Theater dating back to the early 2000s, and it’s probably safe to assume it was once displayed out front. I also found advertising for Guoxing Theater immediately opposite the former site of Āndū Theater (安都戲院), which was probably destroyed decades ago 8 , in the nearby town of Gongguan. There’s something fascinating about this ongoing association with the physical locality of now-vanished theaters and the potential for mass entertainment. No matter if you had just arisen from a 20 year slumber in small town Miaoli, you’d still have known where to catch a movie. Public records suggest this theater was registered in 1969, but this Hakka News segment mentions the theater has 70 years of history. As with Miaoli Theater , few authoritative records of this cinema are readily found online, so an exact date of establishment may remain elusive. ↩ Business records for the original Guoji Theater (1969–2011) identify the original owner as Zhāng Shūpéng (張書鵬). Interestingly, other records indicate Mr. Zhang also owned Xinming Theater (新明戲院, 1980–1997) in Zhongli , already profiled on this site. Since he allegedly bought (and closed) Miaoli Theater and First Theater (第一戲院), also in Miaoli City, it would seem he was something of a theater tycoon. My guess is that he probably owned several other theaters at different points in time.

The former Miaoli Theater (苗栗戲院) is located in the heart of Miaoli City , a mid-sized settlement of 86,000 residents in north-central Taiwan . Approximately 30 theaters were once found scattered around Miaoli County—with at least 5 located here in the city, but as of 2023 only two of those remain standing (with Guoxing Theater being the other one). Few authoritative sources exist to substantiate the early history of Miaoli Theater, but evidence indicates it was operating in the 1950s, and movies were shown all the way into the early 2000s—an unusually long run for a standalone theater from this era.

The Second Air Force New Village ( 二空新村 ) is a former military dependents’ village in Tainan , Taiwan . It was established east of Tainan Airbase in 1950, primarily for members of the Republic of China Air Force and their families, and it eventually grew to become the sixth most populous of the official military villages in Taiwan. From 1950 into the 1960s several waves of construction and development increased the village to nearly 1,000 households, with a sizable number of unregistered structures scattered around the periphery. As with most other military villages this one was steadily dismantled and demolished over the course of many years in the late 2000s and early 2010s, part of a nationwide urban renewal program that relocated the remaining residents into more modern apartment blocks. View Image Details Crossing the Western Trunk Line and heading east into the old military village area. The earliest military villages often accreted around existing Japanese colonial structures, particularly dormitory groups already situated near bases and other facilities, but demand for housing far exceeded supply immediately after approximately two million ROC soldiers and the dependents retreated to war-torn Taiwan in 1949. Many families endured a season in tents or rudimentary bamboo huts with thatched rooftops before provisional housing was constructed out of whatever material was available. Later into the 1950s, as the Chinese Civil War stagnated—and the Cold War deepened—more robust structures made from reinforced concrete became the norm. View Image Details A former gateway to the village is one of a handful of remnants recognized for its heritage value. Second Air Force New Village was established in otherwise empty pastureland east of the airbase in Tainan 1 , supplementing existing housing for military personnel further north and west 2 . Initially fewer than 100 families lived here in red brick houses, but the population exploded as hundreds of new homes were built in successive waves throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Residents had to rely on groundwater for their daily needs until 1972 when the village was finally connected to a water supply. View Image Details Military codes mark one of the few houses remaining in the village in 2017. Soong Mei-ling , wife of Chiang Kai-shek and First Lady of the Republic of China, popularized the cause of military veteran housing through the Chinese Women’s Anti-Communist and Anti-Soviet League ( 中華婦女反共抗俄聯合會 ) in the early 1950s 3 . This same organization is credited for raising funds to build more than half of the homes in the Second Air Force New Village. The fourth round of housing was largely funded by a fruit trading association, hence the presence of a gateway bearing the honorary name Fourth Trading Village (貿易四村). Although it isn’t much to look at, this old gate is among the few remaining relics marked for conservation by the Bureau of Cultural Heritage 4 .

Decades later, with the ROC dream of “retaking the mainland” fading from the collective consciousness, the government embarked upon an ambitious program of urban renewal to relocate qualifying veterans and their families from crowded, often unhygienic conditions, to roomier and more modern apartment blocks. While there were nearly 900 registered military villages around the country only a handful in each region were earmarked for preservation—and apart from a handful of relics, this sprawling settlement was not among them.

The Second Air Force New Village ( 二空新村 ) is a former military dependents’ village in Tainan , Taiwan . It was established east of Tainan Airbase in 1950, primarily for members of the Republic of China Air Force and their families, and it eventually grew to become the sixth most populous of the official military villages in Taiwan. From 1950 into the 1960s several waves of construction and development increased the village to nearly 1,000 households, with a sizable number of unregistered structures scattered around the periphery. As with most other military villages this one was steadily dismantled and demolished over the course of many years in the late 2000s and early 2010s, part of a nationwide urban renewal program that relocated the remaining residents into more modern apartment blocks. View Image Details Crossing the Western Trunk Line and heading east into the old military village area. The earliest military villages often accreted around existing Japanese colonial structures, particularly dormitory groups already situated near bases and other facilities, but demand for housing far exceeded supply immediately after approximately two million ROC soldiers and the dependents retreated to war-torn Taiwan in 1949. Many families endured a season in tents or rudimentary bamboo huts with thatched rooftops before provisional housing was constructed out of whatever material was available. Later into the 1950s, as the Chinese Civil War stagnated—and the Cold War deepened—more robust structures made from reinforced concrete became the norm. View Image Details A former gateway to the village is one of a handful of remnants recognized for its heritage value. Second Air Force New Village was established in otherwise empty pastureland east of the airbase in Tainan 1 , supplementing existing housing for military personnel further north and west 2 . Initially fewer than 100 families lived here in red brick houses, but the population exploded as hundreds of new homes were built in successive waves throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Residents had to rely on groundwater for their daily needs until 1972 when the village was finally connected to a water supply. View Image Details Military codes mark one of the few houses remaining in the village in 2017. Soong Mei-ling , wife of Chiang Kai-shek and First Lady of the Republic of China, popularized the cause of military veteran housing through the Chinese Women’s Anti-Communist and Anti-Soviet League ( 中華婦女反共抗俄聯合會 ) in the early 1950s 3 . This same organization is credited for raising funds to build more than half of the homes in the Second Air Force New Village. The fourth round of housing was largely funded by a fruit trading association, hence the presence of a gateway bearing the honorary name Fourth Trading Village (貿易四村). Although it isn’t much to look at, this old gate is among the few remaining relics marked for conservation by the Bureau of Cultural Heritage 4 .

Decades later, with the ROC dream of “retaking the mainland” fading from the collective consciousness, the government embarked upon an ambitious program of urban renewal to relocate qualifying veterans and their families from crowded, often unhygienic conditions, to roomier and more modern apartment blocks.

Huázhōu Theater (華洲戲院) is a long-abandoned cinema located in Nanxi , a rural district nestled in the low hills of eastern Tainan , Taiwan . Easily reached via Provincial Highway 3 , the main settlement in Nanxi is situated along the middle reaches of Tsengwen River , the fourth longest in the country. Nanxi, like most other parts of rural Taiwan, has suffered an almost continuous population outflow for decades, with household registration numbers almost halving from around 14,000 in 1981 to merely 8,000 in 2023. With so many people departing in search of opportunity in bigger cities we are left to wonder, what inspired the construction of such a large theater in this downtrodden town? View Image Details The spartan appearance of Huazhou Theater from the street. This theater owes its existence to a colossal engineering project found another 10 kilometers upriver: Tsengwen Dam ( 曾文水庫 ), along with its associated reservoir and power generating station ( 曾文發電廠 ). Tsengwen Reservoir is the largest in Taiwan by potential volume 1 , and also the largest in surface area—more than twice that of Sun Moon Lake . Its primary purpose is to provision the historic Wushantou Reservoir by way of a diversion tunnel several kilometers long, and ultimately to irrigate the Chianan Plain . Tsengwen Reservoir also alleviates flooding when typhoons and extreme storms strike this part of the country. View Image Details Jagged metal spires indicate where the four characters naming the theater would have been displayed. View Image Details An oblique view of the purely functional facade. View Image Details The former ticket booth at the entrance Huazhou Theater. The schedule above shows four screenings. Construction began on Tsengwen Dam in October 1967, decades after the idea was initially proposed. It was the dawn of a new age of massive infrastructure projects in Taiwan, and as was common in those days, the workforce largely consisted of KMT military veterans 2 . More than 2,000 laborers relocated to Nanxi to build the dam, and this influx drove the development of a modest entertainment industry in town. Several theaters were established to meet demand 3 , two permanent structures and two open air cinemas. Huazhou Theater was built diagonally across from a bus station where laborers would typically disembark, opening to the public in 1969. View Image Details A first glimpse inside the cavernous ruins of a theater abandoned for decades. Huazhou Theater has a purely functional design with few embellishments, very unlike many of the more ostentatious cinemas found elsewhere in Taiwan. While in business vibrant hand-painted movie posters likely would have adorned the stone-washed cement facade—but even accounting for some additional decoration this theater looks quite plain. Perhaps it was built quickly, without concern for urban luxuries, knowing that the burgeoning population of laborers would only be around for so long? Then again, compared to some of the other theaters in town 4 , it seems Huazhou Theater was considered more comfortable! View Image Details Inside the projection booth at Huazhou Theater. The original projectors are nowhere to be found. View Image Details Vintage power switches to one side of the projection booth. View Image Details Gazing down on the theater from the balcony level. Another curious detail about the design: it is nearly identical to that of Guānghuá Theater 光華戲院 5 in Liugui, another small town further east in back country Kaohsiung . I’ve not been able to substantiate any connection between these theaters from public records but it’s reasonable to assume they were built by the same company. Whether there was any business relationship between their respective owners is another matter, but that too wouldn’t be so surprising.

View Image Details An old bed next to the projection booth. Perhaps the projectionist rested here between screenings. View Image Details View Image Details View Image Details Old wooden seats marked with stenciled numbers. Since Huazhou Theater mainly catered to Chinese laborers they tended to show martial arts and patriotic films in Mandarin Chinese.

View Image Details Decay will accelerate when the rooftop is breached in a storm. View Image Details Approaching the stage. No evidence of the silver screen remains. Tsengwen Dam was completed in April 1973, one season ahead of schedule. As the reservoir began to fill, laborers packed their bags and headed for the local bus station, bound for parts beyond.

Alian ( 阿蓮 ) is a rural township at the northern extent of coastal Kaohsiung , right on the border with Tainan , in southern Taiwan . Although it isn’t a very busy place nowadays, it was once home to two movie theaters, only one of which remains in any form. This is the eponymous Alian Theater (阿蓮戲院), in business since the 1960s, and now a branch of PX Mart (全聯福利中心), the largest supermarket chain in the country. View Image Details The former Alian Theater, now a busy supermarket in the center of this rural market town. Business records 1 indicate Alian Theater was established in 1967 by Bāo Tiānfēi (包天飛). A local guidebook suggests Alian Theater was the successor to Dōngguāng Theater 東光戲院, a cinema with seating for 400 originally located at intersection of Zhongzheng and Minzu, on the northwest corner of the very same city block 2 . Presumably this means the former theater was also owned and operated by Bao Tianfei, but I’ve not seen anything to substantiate this connection. View Image Details Another look at Alian Theater from the front. Townspeople seemed somewhat curious why I’d be interested in this ordinary supermarket. View Image Details Alian Theater from the left. Not much room in this laneway for wide angle photography. I could find no other details about Alian Theater, but some lore about the other theater in town can be found online 3 . Guómín Theater (國民戲院, or National Theater, if you prefer a direct translation) was located on the northwest side of town, in a laneway just west of Minsheng Road, not far from the junior high school. It was operated by local area theater tycoon Yè Zhàochāng (葉兆昌), who also owned theaters in nearby Hunei and Luzhu 4 . It was demolished and converted to housing decades ago. View Image Details A closer look at what must have been the main sign for the old theater, with four characters in its name. View Image Details An oblique view of the theater facade. View Image Details Alian Theater in context, now the main supermarket for this small town in rural Kaohsiung. Apart from that, I can also report nothing of the interior of the theater seems to remain—it looks like an ordinary grocery store inside. There’s always a chance the original projectors and other artifacts of Alian’s cinematic past remain hidden inside somewhere, but staff weren’t interested in my inquiries, so that will remain a mystery for now. Numerous sites share Taiwanese business records, but you may as well try this entry for details. It is also worth noting that the theater may have been operating prior to 1967; my understanding is that businesses were not always registered right away, and data in these old public records is not always completely accurate anyhow. ↩ This information was sourced from a local guidebook, Happy Little Village Alian: Kaohsiung City Alian District Guidebook (幸福小郷有愛啊連：高雄市阿蓮區導覽手冊). Theater capacity information was gleaned from the Taiwan General Guide (台灣通覽), published by Ta-Hwa Evening News (大華晚報社) in 1960, which only lists Dongguang Theater and Guomin Theater operating in Alian. ↩ Information about Guomin Theater was sourced from this blog post . ↩ Several other theaters owned and operated by Ye in the 1960s: Yījiǎ Theater (一甲戲院, demolished); Wànguó Theater 萬國戲院 (in Luzhu, still standing); and Xīnzhuāng Theater (新莊戲院, status unknown) in Yanpu, Pingtung . ↩

View Image Details The former Alian Theater, now a busy supermarket in the center of this rural market town. Business records 1 indicate Alian Theater was established in 1967 by Bāo Tiānfēi (包天飛). A local guidebook suggests Alian Theater was the successor to Dōngguāng Theater 東光戲院, a cinema with seating for 400 originally located at intersection of Zhongzheng and Minzu, on the northwest corner of the very same city block 2 . Presumably this means the former theater was also owned and operated by Bao Tianfei, but I’ve not seen anything to substantiate this connection. View Image Details Another look at Alian Theater from the front. Townspeople seemed somewhat curious why I’d be interested in this ordinary supermarket. View Image Details Alian Theater from the left. Not much room in this laneway for wide angle photography. I could find no other details about Alian Theater, but some lore about the other theater in town can be found online 3 . Guómín Theater (國民戲院, or National Theater, if you prefer a direct translation) was located on the northwest side of town, in a laneway just west of Minsheng Road, not far from the junior high school. It was operated by local area theater tycoon Yè Zhàochāng (葉兆昌), who also owned theaters in nearby Hunei and Luzhu 4 . It was demolished and converted to housing decades ago. View Image Details A closer look at what must have been the main sign for the old theater, with four characters in its name. View Image Details An oblique view of the theater facade. View Image Details Alian Theater in context, now the main supermarket for this small town in rural Kaohsiung. Apart from that, I can also report nothing of the interior of the theater seems to remain—it looks like an ordinary grocery store inside. There’s always a chance the original projectors and other artifacts of Alian’s cinematic past remain hidden inside somewhere, but staff weren’t interested in my inquiries, so that will remain a mystery for now. Numerous sites share Taiwanese business records, but you may as well try this entry for details. It is also worth noting that the theater may have been operating prior to 1967; my understanding is that businesses were not always registered right away, and data in these old public records is not always completely accurate anyhow. ↩ This information was sourced from a local guidebook, Happy Little Village Alian: Kaohsiung City Alian District Guidebook (幸福小郷有愛啊連：高雄市阿蓮區導覽手冊). Theater capacity information was gleaned from the Taiwan General Guide (台灣通覽), published by Ta-Hwa Evening News (大華晚報社) in 1960, which only lists Dongguang Theater and Guomin Theater operating in Alian. ↩ Information about Guomin Theater was sourced from this blog post . ↩ Several other theaters owned and operated by Ye in the 1960s: Yījiǎ Theater (一甲戲院, demolished); Wànguó Theater 萬國戲院 (in Luzhu, still standing); and Xīnzhuāng Theater (新莊戲院, status unknown) in Yanpu, Pingtung . ↩

Tóubiànkēng Police Station (頭汴坑警察官吏派出所) is a remarkably well-preserved Japanese colonial era building situated in a small settlement in the foothills of eastern Taichung , Taiwan . Originally established in 1914, the station was reconstructed to standard specifications with reinforced concrete, red brick, and local cypress, likely in the early 1930s. Not only was it a police station, but it also served as a dormitory for the officers stationed here, agents of a colonial authority keen to extend control into the rugged mountains to the east. After the ROC assumed control of Taiwan operations continued much as before, and was only decommissioned in 1981 when a new police station was built immediately out front. View Image Details Main entrance of the old police station in Toubiankeng. Note the black mark beneath the awning, the former site of an electric light encased in red glass. View Image Details An oblique view of the entrance in black and white. Since it was abandoned the old station has withstood the depredations of typhoons and earthquakes, as well as ongoing weathering and decay. Local townspeople have, at times, pitched in to protect parts of the structure from the elements; note the plastic sheeting over the vaulted rooftop of the main hall, or metal sheeting scattered here and there. Overall the condition of the structure is surprisingly sound, especially given nearly a hundred years of history and almost half as many of neglect!

Linnei is a small rural township located on the south side of the Zhuoshui River in northeastern Yunlin , Taiwan . Despite its strategic position on the Western Trunk Line this township remains mostly pastoral and undeveloped, with little industrial activity compared to neighboring Douliu , the administrative seat of the county. Population in the township peaked at nearly 23,000 in the 1970s and has been declining ever since, recently falling below 18,000 as rural flight continues apace. Nowadays the local economy mostly revolves around agricultural products such as rice, bamboo, and tea, but Linnei was once a major center of tobacco cultivation, traces of which can be found scattered across the countryside. View Image Details This historic family shrine  in Linnei is located where the plains meet the hills. Linnei was settled by Han Chinese in the late 17th century, part of a wider drive to colonize the interior 1 , displacing and assimilating the Plains Indigenous peoples already inhabiting this part of the island. Most township histories attribute the founding of Linnei to Zhèng Cuìpái (鄭萃徘), an immigrant from Zhangzhou in Fujian Province who settled here in the twilight of the reign of the Kangxi Emperor . His living descendants still worship at the Zheng Family Shrine 2 , an old but well-maintained residence with a long courtyard and half-moon pool where the plains meet the hills. View Image Details Old shophouses on Zhongshan Road, immediately in front of the central railway station. View Image Details A relatively well-preserved shophouse on Zhongzheng Road, which runs parallel to the hills at the back of the settlement. The most historic part of Linnei is wedged between the railway line and the low foothills of the Alishan Range to the east. Here you will find a number of Showa era shophouses on Zhongshan Road, a short stretch in front of the railway station , and Zhongzheng Road, the main thoroughfare curving around the thickly vegetated hills at the back of town 3 . These old buildings are uniformly drab and utilitarian, completely unlike the Baroque Revival excesses of Taiping Old Street in nearby Douliu , or the Art Deco-influenced oddities seen a little further west in Xiluo . There were at least two cinemas operating on these streets in the post-war era but no trace remains of any theater in this small town 4 . View Image Details The ruins of an old tobacco barn sandwiched between more modern buildings not far from the central railway station. View Image Details A red brick tobacco barn in Jiǔqiōng Village ( 九芎村 ) in the southern part of Linnei. View Image Details Another view of a red brick tobacco barn in Jioqiong Village. Tobacco cultivation was big business on the inland side of the coastal plains in the late colonial and early post-war periods. The industry went into sharp decline in the 1980s and essentially ended with Taiwan’s accession to the WTO in 2002. Robust preservation efforts in southern and eastern Taiwan ensure many historic sites will be available for future generations to appreciate but fewer tobacco industry sites in central Taiwan have been recognized—and unless I’m mistaken, none whatsoever here in Yunlin County. Plenty of old tobacco barns can still be found around this part of the county, but there’s no guarantee any will remain in the future. One possible exception is an old tobacco barn in a Hakka farming village north of the railway station converted into a modest tourist attraction: Línběikǎhǎo Living Museum 5 . View Image Details Dusky skies over a derelict tobacco barn in the agricultural plains northwest of central Linnei. View Image Details Linbeikahao Living Museum is an old tobacco barn transformed into an educational site. View Image Details The sunken stove inside an old tobacco barn. View Image Details Looking up at the ventilation shaft of a tobacco curing chamber. Supposedly there are nearly two dozen tobacco barns in the township, some as old as 1939, but I suspect that number might be an underestimate. In my few visits to Linnei it was never very difficult to identify tobacco barns simply by riding around the countryside. The distinctive ventilation shafts 6 are easily seen on the horizon, and plenty more can be found in just about every small village—I even found one in close proximity to the central railway station. I’ve read no credible estimates of the number of tobacco farms operating in the peak years, possibly around the the 1960s, but wouldn’t be surprised if hundreds of such buildings once dotted the plains. View Image Details The second torii marking the entrance to the former Linnei Shinto Shrine. This picture was taken at street level, immediately before the long climb begins. View Image Details A long flight of stairs along the visiting path to the former Linnei Shinto Shrine. View Image Details Old stone lantern with the usual defaced base. View Image Details Another style of stone lantern on the hilltop. View Image Details Looking back at the third and final torii marking the site of the old shrine. The former Linnei Shinto Shrine ( 林內神社 ) was completed in 1940 with conscripted labor from around the township. It is unusually large in scale considering the modest size of Linnei—and also qualifies as the most well-preserved former Shinto site in all of Yunlin. Featured here are three torii , several stone lanterns, a visiting path with more than 200 steps leading up to a scenic viewpoint, and an assortment of other relics and monuments. The first two torii are reinforced concrete originals in the myōjin style (明神鳥居), somewhat rare for Taiwan, but both were modified in the post-war era with flared green tile additions to the upper lintels, likely an attempt to make them appear vaguely more Chinese 7 . The third torii standing at the top of the hill is a modern replica presumably made for tourism purposes. A temple venerating Ji Gong , the drunken monk of Chinese folk religion , now stands at the former site of the main hall of the shrine, which was completely destroyed in the post-war era 8 . View Image Details The view from the former Linnei Shinto Shrine, looking northwest across the plains of Yunlin County. View Image Details The notorious Linnei Incinerator, an enormous installation laying idle on the south side of Zhoushui River. The hulking mass of the immense Linnei Garbage Incinerator 9 is plainly visible on the horizon from the viewpoint at the former shrine. This incinerator became national news after it was involved in one of the most egregious cases of political corruption since democratization. Taiwan, once known as “garbage island” for its overflowing landfills 10 , invested heavily in industrial-scale incinerators in the 1990s. This particular incinerator began construction in 2002, but it was soon discovered that county magistrate Chang Jung-wei ( 張榮味 ) had taken a huge kickback from the construction company, leading to his arrest in 2004. After working through the courts for many years, Chang ultimately went to jail for this crime, and the incinerator was never activated. It remains idle today. In a shocking coincidence, Chang’s sister is now the county magistrate. View Image Details The former office of the Mitsubishi Paper Factory Co., Ltd. View Image Details A pulp tank at the former Japanese colonial era paper factory on the outskirts of Linnei. Linnei New Park (林內新公園) is located a short distance from the station north of the railway line. In the early Japanese colonial era it was the site of the Taiwan Mitsubishi Paper Mill (臺灣三菱製紙所), constructed to produce paper from giant timber bamboo harvested in the interior beginning in 1911. The mill shut down only a few short years later, allegedly because there was little commercial demand for the quality of paper produced here 11 . While much of the plant fell into disuse, the former company office building enjoyed a second life as the township office, and was ultimately designated a heritage property in 2006. Several projects installed around the park for the Grassroots Art Festival (草根藝術祭) of 2014 have made this a popular stopover for wedding photographers and the like. View Image Details An old water bridge next to the new Zhoushui Hydroelectric Power Plant. View Image Details Nearly a century old, this Japanese colonial era hydroelectric plant is nearly unique for being located on the plains of western Taiwan. Linnei is also home to the hundred year-old Zhoushui Hydroelectric Power Station ( 濁水水力發電所 ). It is one of the very few hydroelectric power stations located on the western plains. Fed by water diverted from the Zhoushui River and completed in 1923, it was constructed to provide power for the construction of Wushantou Reservoir and an enormous network of irrigation canals extending across the Chianan Plain . It was recognized as a historic site in 2004 and decommissioned shortly thereafter. A second power station built next door went online in 2011. View Image Details An unidentified abandonment located near the incinerator. This building no longer exists. View Image Details Inside an abandoned office in the rural wastelands of Linnei. View Image Details One of many gravel mines on the banks of the highly silted Zhoushui River. View Image Details Irrigation water control towers not far from Bagua Pond. View Image Details An irrigation pipe running along the hillside opposite the central station. Water likely entered this system at the Linnei Water Gate 林內水門 , located around the bend of the foothills. View Image Details An obscure monument on a Japanese colonial era bridge pylon. Watch for it next time you cross the Zhoushui River on a regular train. The first bridge spanning the Zhoushui River was completed in 1907, connecting north and south Taiwan by rail 12 . This single track Schwedler truss iron bridge was in service until the early 1960s when it was demolished after being replaced by a more modern double track bridge. A third generation Zhoushui River Bridge was completed in 1990, part of a nationwide bridge reconstruction project , and the second bridge was also dismantled. While constructing the bridge still in use today Taiwan Railway Administration engineers noticed the lone pylon still standing on the south bank of river where it was erected at the beginning of the century. Rather than destroy they pylon they decided to transform it into a monument, installing a stone engraved with the simple inscription “Zhoushui River Bridge” (濁水溪橋). If you know when and where to look you can see it from the window of any TRA train crossing this bridge. View Image Details An abandoned gas station on the hazy borderlands of Yunlin and Nantou in Taiwan. View Image Details The abandoned Yixin Vocational High School on the south side of Linnei. That’s all for this travelogue from central Taiwan. I’ve previously published two additional articles from Linnei, one on the derelict Yixin Vocational High School , and another about an abandoned gas station , both with surprisingly morbid themes. This edition of my Postcards From Taiwan collection fills a gap between Zhushan , Ershui , and Xiluo ; if you’re curious to see more from the area, peruse those articles as well.

Watch for it next time you cross the Zhoushui River on a regular train. The first bridge spanning the Zhoushui River was completed in 1907, connecting north and south Taiwan by rail 12 . This single track Schwedler truss iron bridge was in service until the early 1960s when it was demolished after being replaced by a more modern double track bridge. A third generation Zhoushui River Bridge was completed in 1990, part of a nationwide bridge reconstruction project , and the second bridge was also dismantled. While constructing the bridge still in use today Taiwan Railway Administration engineers noticed the lone pylon still standing on the south bank of river where it was erected at the beginning of the century. Rather than destroy they pylon they decided to transform it into a monument, installing a stone engraved with the simple inscription “Zhoushui River Bridge” (濁水溪橋). If you know when and where to look you can see it from the window of any TRA train crossing this bridge.

That’s all for this travelogue from central Taiwan. I’ve previously published two additional articles from Linnei, one on the derelict Yixin Vocational High School , and another about an abandoned gas station , both with surprisingly morbid themes. This edition of my Postcards From Taiwan collection fills a gap between Zhushan , Ershui , and Xiluo ; if you’re curious to see more from the area, peruse those articles as well. This colonization effort is related in greater detail in this post about Zhushan , the district immediately to the east of Linnei. ↩ More photos and information about the Zheng Family Shrine (鄭氏宗祠) can be found here . ↩ Just A Balcony has two excellent features on the shophouses of Linnei, one for Zhongzheng Road (中正路) and another for Zhongshan Road 中山路 . ↩ Linnei was once home to the eponymous Linnei Theater (林內戲院), likely built in the 1940s and located on Zhongshan Road #7, right in front of the train station. I’ve also found reference to Tónglè Theater 同樂戲院, which was situated somewhere on Zhongzheng Road in the 1960s. (The old address in my notes is 中正路31號 but street numbers were likely reassigned since then.) ↩ This blog goes into greater detail about what you’ll find at the tobacco museum in Linnei. While the name (林北卡好數位生活館) is neutral in Mandarin Chinese, the first part is a mild curse word in Taiwanese Hokkien . ↩ For more about the distinctive architectural features of Taiwanese tobacco barns I recommend starting with my post about the Shuinan Tobacco Barn in Taichung . ↩ Read more about the history of Linnei Shinto Shrine on Chinese language blogs here , here , here . ↩ Steven Crook features this temple (and the scenic trail beyond) in this solid article for the Taipei Times. As for the destruction of the shrine, some sources suggest it happened in the late 1950s. ↩ Linnei Garbage Incinerator (林內焚化爐) came to my attention by way of Mirage: Disused Public Property in Taiwan , a collection by artist Yao Jui-Chung (姚瑞中). ↩ More about Taiwan’s transition from “garbage island” to recycling leader be read in this article . ↩ A large swathe of land in Nantou was expropriated for bamboo farming, angering local Taiwanese and leading to a deadly confrontation . Although this isn’t the direct cause of the closure of the bamboo paper mill in Linnei it was likely a contributing factor. It is also known as the former Bǎolóng Paper Factory (寶隆紙廠), which operated on this site starting in the 1960s. Read more about the paper factory here . ↩ Although this bridge is on the Western Trunk Line it wasn’t the only railway bridge spanning the Zhoushui River. The more iconic Xiluo Bridge , completed in 1952, also carried sugar railway trains for a time. ↩

The overgrown ruins of Kǒuhú Theater (口湖戲院) can be found along a dusty country road on the outskirts of Kouhu , a desolate town in coastal Yunlin , at the westernmost extent of the Taiwanese mainland. Its most distinct feature is the exposed red brick facade, which might be unique among those vintage theaters still standing in earthquake-prone Taiwan . Not much is written about this old theater online, possibly due to its obscure location in the remote countryside, but it dates back to the early 1950s and likely remained in operation into the early 1980s. View Image Details An exterior view of Kouhu Theater from the small patch of land in front, not far from where the sugar trains would have rumbled by decades ago. The earliest record of this theater can be found in a local publication 1 from 1955, in which the founder of the theater is identified as Cài Kēng (蔡坑). Business records 2 also indicate some activity may have taken place as late as 1979. No records of what films it screened remain, but it was not exclusively a cinema. Apart from showing movies, Kouhu Theater also hosted traditional opera, glove puppet shows, community events such as graduation and awards ceremonies—and even singing contests 3 . View Image Details An oblique view of the entrance to Kouhu Theater, traces of its name faintly visible in white at the top of the facade. View Image Details The remains of the ticket booth at Kouhu Theater, unusually constructed out of wood. View Image Details Looking back from the interior of Kouhu Theater, overgrown and filled with mosquitos. Beyond that, additional context can be inferred by taking a closer look at local history and geography. As it turns out, this theater was built along an old sugar railway line connecting this village to Chiayi City by way of Beigang , which is due east. Immediately to the north of the theater is the Kouhu Township Farmers’ Association (口湖鄉農會), an important focal point for the agricultural industry, and the former Taisugar Wūmáyuán Station (糖鐵原烏麻園車站), which offered passenger service until 1982 3 . With a ridership of around 5,000 at its peak—with anywhere from 22 to 32 schedules trains a day—this now-desolate area probably received quite a lot of foot traffic back in the day. I would imagine the suspension of passenger service signaled the end for this theater, if indeed it was still in business. View Image Details A wider view of the interior, which was strewn with garbage, and incredibly overgrown. Apart from the peculiar use of red brick, I was also perplexed by the structure of the projection booth after entering the old theater. Rather than the characteristic staggered portholes seen in pretty much every vintage theater, the booth inside Kouhu Theater features a rectangular window. Presumably this would have been partly covered with fabric or some other material at some point, but I wonder if this indicates little familiarity with standard cinema design on behalf of the builders. I’m also not sure how the carbon arc lamp projectors would have been cooled given the slope of the roof and the lack of ventilation shafts. Whatever the case, it is impressive this rudimentary red brick theater is still standing at all after so many years. View Image Details The remains of the former stage at Kouhu Theater. This must have been covered with wooden floorboards at some point in the distant past. No evidence of a screen could be discerned. View Image Details A view of the theater from the lot next door. Reviewing the handful of photos of this theater available online 4 suggests Kouhu Theater likely collapsed sometime around 2013, greatly accelerating its rate of decay. Older photos also show the name of the theater in white painted characters running right-to-left along the top of the facade, but these were almost completely invisible when I visited in early 2022. I wouldn’t expect it to remain standing for much longer; once the roof comes down, the rest usually follows, especially given how this theater was built.

Ruìmào Theater (瑞茂戲院) is an old wooden theater hidden in the winding laneways of Guògōu (過溝), a small fishing and farming village in remote coastal Chiayi , Taiwan . Nobody seems to know exactly when this theater was established, although there is general agreement it likely dates back to the early post-war era. Remarkably, it was one of two theaters in this settlement, and one of maybe a dozen along this stretch of coast in the 1970s, when salt production and oyster farming buoyed the local economy. As with most other theaters of its vintage, this one closed sometime in the 1980s. View Image Details An abandoned theater on the winding roads of a small town in coastal Chiayi County. From the street this theater almost looks like it might be constructed with reinforced concrete, but the facade is mostly brick with a pebble-washed exterior. Hints of Baroque Revival styling, popular in the late Japanese colonial era , can be seen at the top of the facade, but the rest of the structure exudes early KMT utilitarianism . The interior of the theater is almost entirely made with Taiwanese cypress , not a common building material for cinemas, at least not those still standing. This theater would have used carbon arc lamp projectors when showing films. Such projectors are notorious fire hazards, so it’s a small miracle this theater hasn’t been set ablaze over the years.

Guogou residents taking to Facebook to share memories recall how this theater was more than just a cinema; it was also a venue for puppet shows , Taiwanese opera , and concerts. As with most other theaters in those days, new screenings and performances were advertised by pedal power, using a tricycle displaying posters and such. The driver would ride around town, calling out upcoming shows and handing out leaflets. Although no mention was made of movie posters, it is likely they would have been draped across the exterior when the theater was still in operation. View Image Details Machine parts discarded on the theater floor. Whether these are remnants of the knitting factory or something else entirely remains unknown. After the theater closed, probably sometime in the early 1980s, it was repurposed for use as the Fāngzhōu Knitting Factory (芳洲針織廠). Very little trace of this second life remains, though it may explain the lack of seating and other theater paraphernalia in the interior. Several rusted metal hulks and plastic tubing laying coiled on the dusty floor might have something to do with thread-making, but then again, maybe not. View Image Details A view of the balcony and the projection booth from a pile of rubble. Obviously the knitting factory went out of business at some point, after which the theater was finally abandoned to the elements. From what I’ve read it sounds like the back of the theater collapsed during a particularly violent typhoon, but I’ve seen no indication of when that might have occurred. Apparently there was some talk of seeking heritage status for this building years ago, but the owners are either disinterested or nowhere to be found, and by now the structure is beyond repair. Its ultimate passage into memory is only a matter of time. View Image Details The majestic wooden roof and elevated projection booth.

Zìchéng Theater (自成大戲院) is a derelict cinema located in Baozhong , a rural township on the coastal plains of Yunlin , Taiwan . After opening in 1966 this theater drew enormous crowds from the surrounding districts, particularly in its early years of operation, when it was customary for movie stars to appear on stage to promote new films. Business began to decline with the closure of the nearby sugar factory and the widespread adoption of home television in the late 1970s, ultimately leading to the final screening sometime around 1985. Since then the theater has remained idle, slowly decaying with the passage of years, its fading fortunes mirroring those of the surrounding settlement. View Image Details A first glance at Zicheng Theater from the street. View Image Details The entrance to Zicheng Theater is littered with the detritus of failed political campaigns. In this case, Sū Shūzhū ( 蘇淑珠 ) ran in the 2014 Taiwanese local elections but did not win . Baozhong hasn’t always been so desolate; it prospered during the booming years of the Taiwan Miracle , partly due to its proximity to Lóngyán Sugar Factory ( 龍巖糖廠 ), originally located just north of town. Founded in 1935 by the Dai-Nippon Sugar Co. , the factory was nationalized under the control of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation after the war. At its peak in the 1950s it employed more than 500 factory workers and auxiliary staff 1 , and supported thousands of other jobs for farmers and general laborers in the surrounding countryside. All this economic activity generated a demand for entertainment—which is what prompted a member of the local gentry to invest in building what was, in those days, such an impressive movie theater.

Zìchéng Theater (自成大戲院) is a derelict cinema located in Baozhong , a rural township on the coastal plains of Yunlin , Taiwan . After opening in 1966 this theater drew enormous crowds from the surrounding districts, particularly in its early years of operation, when it was customary for movie stars to appear on stage to promote new films. Business began to decline with the closure of the nearby sugar factory and the widespread adoption of home television in the late 1970s, ultimately leading to the final screening sometime around 1985. Since then the theater has remained idle, slowly decaying with the passage of years, its fading fortunes mirroring those of the surrounding settlement. View Image Details A first glance at Zicheng Theater from the street. View Image Details The entrance to Zicheng Theater is littered with the detritus of failed political campaigns. In this case, Sū Shūzhū ( 蘇淑珠 ) ran in the 2014 Taiwanese local elections but did not win . Baozhong hasn’t always been so desolate; it prospered during the booming years of the Taiwan Miracle , partly due to its proximity to Lóngyán Sugar Factory ( 龍巖糖廠 ), originally located just north of town. Founded in 1935 by the Dai-Nippon Sugar Co. , the factory was nationalized under the control of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation after the war. At its peak in the 1950s it employed more than 500 factory workers and auxiliary staff 1 , and supported thousands of other jobs for farmers and general laborers in the surrounding countryside. All this economic activity generated a demand for entertainment—which is what prompted a member of the local gentry to invest in building what was, in those days, such an impressive movie theater.

This entry documents my final day of riding on a bicycle trip down the Huadong Valley in 2018 . I began with a short yet eventful spin around Taitung City , the administrative capital of Taitung , and headed southwest across the alluvial plains before curving back to catch a train bound for Taipei in the afternoon. I already introduced the history, geography, and culture of Taitung City in this post from a previous visit in 2015 , so I’ll focus on specific sites I visited on this particular trip. View Image Details An oblique look at a medical clinic occupying a former movie theater in Taitung City. After checking out of the hotel and wolfing down breakfast I set out to visit what remains of the cinema industry here in Taitung City. First among these relics is Tàihé Theater (泰和戲院), later renamed Hépíng Theater, and now known as the Dōnghé External Medicine Clinic (東和外科診所). Established in 1950, it reputedly had a capacity of 1,200, which might have made it the largest theater in the county. It went out of business in the late 1980s and was converted into a hospital sometime later on 1 . Nowadays the iconic facade, painted bone white, remains plainly visible at one of the main intersections in town. View Image Details The former Taihe Theater in central Taitung City. View Image Details One last glance at Datong Theater, which was subsequently demolished. Datong Theater (大同戲院), tucked away an in alleyway nearby, is pretty much where my theater project began. I found it entirely by accident on my previous trip to Taitung City and it set into motion this peculiar hobby I still practice years later. This is my last photograph of the final vintage theater operating in all of Taitung—since then it has been completely demolished, despite efforts to preserve at least the front part of the building. View Image Details Beneath this corrugated metal cladding lies the oldest extant movie theater in the county. The last inner city theater on my list is also Taitung’s oldest: New World Theater (新世界戲院), later renamed Xīnxīng Theater (新興戲院), with a reported capacity of 1,000. It was established in the Japanese colonial era, although nobody seems to know exactly when, and it doubled as a hospital during the war, when Americans dropped bombs all over Taiwan. In the post-war era it prospered as a multi-use entertainment venue, hosting traditional Taiwanese opera and puppet shows alongside film screenings. View Image Details Historic plaques and photographs visible on the side of Xinxing Theater in an old quarter of Taitung City. In the 1980s Xinxing Theater adapted to changing consumer demand and became a venue notorious for more risqué forms of live entertainment 2 . After it went out of business, possibly in the early 2000s, it was slated for redevelopment, but there is some disagreement about land ownership, and its fate remains in limbo. Sometime after 2010 the front of theater was encased in sheet metal, obscuring the ticket booth and original sign, as the structure has fallen into deep disrepair 3 . Several historic photographs are displayed along the side of the building to provide some context for anyone curious about this old ruin. View Image Details A loading dock at the Taitung Taiwan Liquor Bureau Depot. View Image Details The infamous Taitung City White House not long after its builder passed away. One of the more unusual features of the urban landscape of Taitung City is the White House ( 白色陋屋 ) 4 , a former coastline sentry post 5 converted into a ramshackle home by Lǐ Wénchāng (李文昌), a KMT veteran originally stationed there. Mr. Li was born in Guangxi Province in 1928 and arrived in Taiwan in the tumultuous years following the resumption of the Chinese Civil War . Initially based in Tainan, he was assigned to Taitung in 1966, where he soon married and fathered six children. The guard post forming the foundation of the White House was abolished sometime in the 1970s—and Mr. Li spent the next 40 years scavenging materials to continually expand it by hand, ostensibly to bequeath to his children some day. View Image Details A closer look at the rapidly decaying front of the White House. Typhoons frequently strike Taitung and this building won’t last long without regular upkeep. Mr. Li’s home began to attract considerable attention in the mid-2010s, around when the old fertilizer factory adjacent to his property was torn down. It became popular on social media, particularly Instagram, and news reports and human interest stories soon followed 6 . Sadly, Mr. Li passed away in 2017, and none of his offspring returned to claim the house he built for them with his own hands. I am not aware of any plan to preserve the building, and even a year later it was already showing considerable wear and tear due to neglect and the yearly bombardment of typhoons. I would not expect it to remain standing for long. View Image Details A curved boardwalk and intriguing work of public art at the Taitung Seashore Park. View Image Details Fishing in the ocean on a hot day in late spring. Despite its seaside location there is no harbour in the city itself, and consequently not much of a local fishing industry. I cruised out to the coastline at Taitung Seaside Park (台東海濱公園) to capture a few photos before heading out of town. Here I found the Taitung Tree of Life (台東生命之樹), an enormous work of public art erected in 2016 and accessible from a curved boardwalk. There isn’t too much to see out here—the beach is long and desolate, mostly covered with stones, and with no place to avoid the tropical sun. Taitung City also has no harbour at its waterfront—back in the day goods were ferried to shore with small boats. View Image Details Classic KMT authoritarian civic architecture on display at the Taitung County Swimming Pool. View Image Details I assumed this was another one of Taiwan’s many “mosquito museums” at first, but apparently it’s just not open year-round. Heading west across the city I couldn’t help but notice the rundown state of the Taitung County Swimming Pool (台東縣立游泳池), a typical example of KMT authoritarian era civic infrastructure built in 1984. Initially I assumed it might have been abandoned, but a closer look at a sign out front suggested it might only open during the summer. It was demolished in 2021 to make way for a new county library 7 . View Image Details Taitung Martyrs’ Shrine, formerly the top-ranking State Shinto shrine in Taitung. View Image Details Former stone lantern bases on display at the base of Carp Mountain in Taitung City. Make what you will of the color scheme. My last stop on the way out of town was the former Taitung Shinto Shrine 台東神社, now the Taitung Martyrs’ Shrine (台東鯉魚山忠烈祠). I wrote more about this site in my previous post about Taitung City but neglected to get some good photos of the stone lantern bases—so here they are, looking very much like a bunch of Lego blocks thanks to that garish paint job. View Image Details Not much remains of the Xucun Immigrant Village to indicate anything about the history of this place except for a lonely stone lantern. Exiting the city to the southwest I cruised across the plains to the former Xù (or Asahi) Immigrant Village (旭移民村), privately established by the Taitung Sugar Factory ( 台東糖廠 ) in 1917 to provide housing for ethnic Japanese sugarcane farmers 8 . It does not seem as if this particular immigrant village grew very large—at its peak, it was likely home to fewer than 100 households 9 . As with other immigrant villages it was depopulated not long after the handover to the KMT, almost certainly by spring of 1946. View Image Details The temple occupying the site of Xucun’s former Shinto shrine has an unusual idol out front: the mythical beast Lu Shu. I made a brief stop at Fèngshùn Temple (奉順宮), the former site of the Asahi Shinto Shrine 旭村社, but all that remains is a lone stone lantern. A closer look at the temple revealed a rare mythical beast by the name of Lù Shǔ (鹿蜀), not a normal sight in Taiwanese temples. It is typically described as a horse with a white head, tiger stripes, a flowing red tail, and a beautiful singing voice. Obviously its manifestation here takes some creative liberties with this description. View Image Details Jinxing Theater from the highway. From the outside it appears to be in fairly decent shape. A local man waves from the steps, where he customarily smokes cigarettes and watches passing traffic. Eight kilometers further west I entered the primarily Indigenous settlement of Zhīběn (知本), home to the Katipul group (卡地布部落) of the Puyuma people (卑南族). I was here to visit two theaters in this small town, both of which were constructed in the late 1960s to cater to the thousands of KMT veterans who emigrated here to work on state-sponsored land reclamation and agriculture projects. Each theater deserves its own post, so I encourage you to take a moment to check out Jinxing Theater (金星大戲院) and Dongxing Theater (東興大戲院) before moving on. View Image Details The view from the empty lot in front of Dongxing Theater. View Image Details ROC symbology integrated into the design of this modest home indicates it is almost certainly that of a KMT veteran who settled out here in the late 1960s. View Image Details This quirky temple located along Provincial Highway 9 is known as the Xinyuan Village Guanyin Cave ( 新園里觀音洞 ). This village is also known by its Indigenous name, Sasoaza. View Image Details Chinese door markers with Christian characteristics. View Image Details A road sign in Taromak. Rainclouds gathered as I headed north from Zhiben toward Taromak ( 達魯瑪克 ), the easternmost settlement of the Rukai people (魯凱族), who mostly reside in modern-day Pingtung . I was intent on locating the ruins of the Dànán Shinto Shrine ( 大南社 ), established in the twilight of the Japanese colonial era in 1943, but was ultimately unsuccessful. I contented myself with some quick snapshots of road signs 10 and forged on to the next destination. View Image Details All that remains of the Lijia Shinto Shrine. Following the curve of the foothills at the edge of the alluvial plains I made my way to Likavung, or Lìjiā (利嘉), another important Puyuma village 11 . Here, with some assistance from local residents, I was able to locate the remains of the Lijia Shinto Shrine (呂家祠 in the original Japanese), also constructed in 1943. Only the concrete pedestal remains, but I felt a sense of accomplishment in finding it, since I hadn’t been able to pinpoint the location in advance research. View Image Details Millet Harvest Mural in Lijkavung Several murals caught my eye on the way out of Likavung. These, I have learned, are the work of Puyuma artist and musician Ushiw Pakaruku, or Yáng Mùrén (楊慕仁), who works out of a studio in the Taitung Sugar Factory 12 . The first mural depicts what I would assume is the millet harvest, although it might also have something to do with the Puyuma legend of the origin of millet in their culture 13 . The second mural shows the Puyuma meeting an expedition of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), likely in 1637 or 1638. The Dutch were interested in rumors of gold in the mountains of Taitung and negotiated mining rights with the Puyuma, an alliance that lasted until VOC representative Maarten Wesseling was killed in 1641, probably not far from where this mural is found today. A punitive mission followed in 1642, and from what I’ve read, the Dutch never did find any gold around here before they were expelled by Koxinga two decades later 14 . View Image Details A Mural Depicting the Puyuma Meeting the Dutch View Image Details A typical street scene riding east on Provincial Highway 9 through the suburbs of Taitung City. I exited Likavung and headed east along Provincial Highway 9 , making few stops on my way to the train station; it seemed certain to rain and I was disinclined to end this trip in a downpour. One last site deserves some explication, however, and that would be an example of Indigenous Puyuma architecture I noticed along the roadside in the village of Lanown, or Nánwáng (南王). From what I’ve read this is almost certainly a dakuvan (少年會所), typically translated as “juvenile assembly hall” or “youth club”, which boys enter around the age of 12 or 13 to undergo years of training to become adults. In traditional Puyuma societies boys would only move out of the dakuvan after getting married, but I would imagine things are very different these days. View Image Details A gleaming statue at the site of the future Zhongdao Taitung Buddhist Statue Museum ( 中道台東佛像博物館 ). View Image Details Puyuma assembly hall on the side of the highway in the village of Lanown. This is likely a youth assembly hall. Not long after leaving Lanown behind I arrived at Taitung Station (台東車站). Here I purchased a ticket, did my best to clean up after another sweaty day of riding, and concluded nearly a week of riding down the Huadong Valley of eastern Taiwan , probably around 250 kilometers in all. This final report brings the entire series to approximately 26,000 words and nearly 300 photos. Given the amount of effort required to properly research and describe every point of interest I found along the way it may be quite some time before I publish another series like this one—but I am very grateful for how much I learned along the way. Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed reading about the many natural wonders, historical sites, and cultural features of eastern Taiwan I documented on this epic bicycle trip! Business records indicate Taihe Theater was renamed in 1966. Some additional details were gleaned from this blog entry , which sadly features a bunch of broken images. ↩ Here I refer to what is euphemistically known as niúròuchǎng (牛肉場), literally “beef market”, essentially a Taiwanese form of burlesque involving singing, dancing, comedy, and yes—the baring of flesh. I go into additional detail about this custom in this article . ↩ As recently as 2010 the front part of the theater was still visible from the street. This gallery of photos on Flickr and this blog entry provide additional information about the state of the structure at that time. ↩ It might be more accurate to translate this as the White Hovel, or perhaps the White Shanty House. On Wikipedia it is listed, in English, as the Moving Castle , a reference to Howl’s Moving Castle .

Sometime after 2010 the front of theater was encased in sheet metal, obscuring the ticket booth and original sign, as the structure has fallen into deep disrepair 3 . Several historic photographs are displayed along the side of the building to provide some context for anyone curious about this old ruin. View Image Details A loading dock at the Taitung Taiwan Liquor Bureau Depot. View Image Details The infamous Taitung City White House not long after its builder passed away. One of the more unusual features of the urban landscape of Taitung City is the White House ( 白色陋屋 ) 4 , a former coastline sentry post 5 converted into a ramshackle home by Lǐ Wénchāng (李文昌), a KMT veteran originally stationed there. Mr. Li was born in Guangxi Province in 1928 and arrived in Taiwan in the tumultuous years following the resumption of the Chinese Civil War . Initially based in Tainan, he was assigned to Taitung in 1966, where he soon married and fathered six children. The guard post forming the foundation of the White House was abolished sometime in the 1970s—and Mr. Li spent the next 40 years scavenging materials to continually expand it by hand, ostensibly to bequeath to his children some day. View Image Details A closer look at the rapidly decaying front of the White House. Typhoons frequently strike Taitung and this building won’t last long without regular upkeep. Mr. Li’s home began to attract considerable attention in the mid-2010s, around when the old fertilizer factory adjacent to his property was torn down. It became popular on social media, particularly Instagram, and news reports and human interest stories soon followed 6 . Sadly, Mr. Li passed away in 2017, and none of his offspring returned to claim the house he built for them with his own hands. I am not aware of any plan to preserve the building, and even a year later it was already showing considerable wear and tear due to neglect and the yearly bombardment of typhoons. I would not expect it to remain standing for long. View Image Details A curved boardwalk and intriguing work of public art at the Taitung Seashore Park. View Image Details Fishing in the ocean on a hot day in late spring. Despite its seaside location there is no harbour in the city itself, and consequently not much of a local fishing industry. I cruised out to the coastline at Taitung Seaside Park (台東海濱公園) to capture a few photos before heading out of town. Here I found the Taitung Tree of Life (台東生命之樹), an enormous work of public art erected in 2016 and accessible from a curved boardwalk. There isn’t too much to see out here—the beach is long and desolate, mostly covered with stones, and with no place to avoid the tropical sun. Taitung City also has no harbour at its waterfront—back in the day goods were ferried to shore with small boats. View Image Details Classic KMT authoritarian civic architecture on display at the Taitung County Swimming Pool. View Image Details I assumed this was another one of Taiwan’s many “mosquito museums” at first, but apparently it’s just not open year-round. Heading west across the city I couldn’t help but notice the rundown state of the Taitung County Swimming Pool (台東縣立游泳池), a typical example of KMT authoritarian era civic infrastructure built in 1984. Initially I assumed it might have been abandoned, but a closer look at a sign out front suggested it might only open during the summer. It was demolished in 2021 to make way for a new county library 7 . View Image Details Taitung Martyrs’ Shrine, formerly the top-ranking State Shinto shrine in Taitung. View Image Details Former stone lantern bases on display at the base of Carp Mountain in Taitung City. Make what you will of the color scheme. My last stop on the way out of town was the former Taitung Shinto Shrine 台東神社, now the Taitung Martyrs’ Shrine (台東鯉魚山忠烈祠). I wrote more about this site in my previous post about Taitung City but neglected to get some good photos of the stone lantern bases—so here they are, looking very much like a bunch of Lego blocks thanks to that garish paint job. View Image Details Not much remains of the Xucun Immigrant Village to indicate anything about the history of this place except for a lonely stone lantern. Exiting the city to the southwest I cruised across the plains to the former Xù (or Asahi) Immigrant Village (旭移民村), privately established by the Taitung Sugar Factory ( 台東糖廠 ) in 1917 to provide housing for ethnic Japanese sugarcane farmers 8 . It does not seem as if this particular immigrant village grew very large—at its peak, it was likely home to fewer than 100 households 9 . As with other immigrant villages it was depopulated not long after the handover to the KMT, almost certainly by spring of 1946. View Image Details The temple occupying the site of Xucun’s former Shinto shrine has an unusual idol out front: the mythical beast Lu Shu. I made a brief stop at Fèngshùn Temple (奉順宮), the former site of the Asahi Shinto Shrine 旭村社, but all that remains is a lone stone lantern. A closer look at the temple revealed a rare mythical beast by the name of Lù Shǔ (鹿蜀), not a normal sight in Taiwanese temples. It is typically described as a horse with a white head, tiger stripes, a flowing red tail, and a beautiful singing voice. Obviously its manifestation here takes some creative liberties with this description. View Image Details Jinxing Theater from the highway. From the outside it appears to be in fairly decent shape. A local man waves from the steps, where he customarily smokes cigarettes and watches passing traffic. Eight kilometers further west I entered the primarily Indigenous settlement of Zhīběn (知本), home to the Katipul group (卡地布部落) of the Puyuma people (卑南族). I was here to visit two theaters in this small town, both of which were constructed in the late 1960s to cater to the thousands of KMT veterans who emigrated here to work on state-sponsored land reclamation and agriculture projects. Each theater deserves its own post, so I encourage you to take a moment to check out Jinxing Theater (金星大戲院) and Dongxing Theater (東興大戲院) before moving on. View Image Details The view from the empty lot in front of Dongxing Theater. View Image Details ROC symbology integrated into the design of this modest home indicates it is almost certainly that of a KMT veteran who settled out here in the late 1960s. View Image Details This quirky temple located along Provincial Highway 9 is known as the Xinyuan Village Guanyin Cave ( 新園里觀音洞 ). This village is also known by its Indigenous name, Sasoaza. View Image Details Chinese door markers with Christian characteristics. View Image Details A road sign in Taromak. Rainclouds gathered as I headed north from Zhiben toward Taromak ( 達魯瑪克 ), the easternmost settlement of the Rukai people (魯凱族), who mostly reside in modern-day Pingtung . I was intent on locating the ruins of the Dànán Shinto Shrine ( 大南社 ), established in the twilight of the Japanese colonial era in 1943, but was ultimately unsuccessful. I contented myself with some quick snapshots of road signs 10 and forged on to the next destination. View Image Details All that remains of the Lijia Shinto Shrine. Following the curve of the foothills at the edge of the alluvial plains I made my way to Likavung, or Lìjiā (利嘉), another important Puyuma village 11 . Here, with some assistance from local residents, I was able to locate the remains of the Lijia Shinto Shrine (呂家祠 in the original Japanese), also constructed in 1943. Only the concrete pedestal remains, but I felt a sense of accomplishment in finding it, since I hadn’t been able to pinpoint the location in advance research. View Image Details Millet Harvest Mural in Lijkavung Several murals caught my eye on the way out of Likavung. These, I have learned, are the work of Puyuma artist and musician Ushiw Pakaruku, or Yáng Mùrén (楊慕仁), who works out of a studio in the Taitung Sugar Factory 12 . The first mural depicts what I would assume is the millet harvest, although it might also have something to do with the Puyuma legend of the origin of millet in their culture 13 . The second mural shows the Puyuma meeting an expedition of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), likely in 1637 or 1638. The Dutch were interested in rumors of gold in the mountains of Taitung and negotiated mining rights with the Puyuma, an alliance that lasted until VOC representative Maarten Wesseling was killed in 1641, probably not far from where this mural is found today. A punitive mission followed in 1642, and from what I’ve read, the Dutch never did find any gold around here before they were expelled by Koxinga two decades later 14 . View Image Details A Mural Depicting the Puyuma Meeting the Dutch View Image Details A typical street scene riding east on Provincial Highway 9 through the suburbs of Taitung City. I exited Likavung and headed east along Provincial Highway 9 , making few stops on my way to the train station; it seemed certain to rain and I was disinclined to end this trip in a downpour. One last site deserves some explication, however, and that would be an example of Indigenous Puyuma architecture I noticed along the roadside in the village of Lanown, or Nánwáng (南王). From what I’ve read this is almost certainly a dakuvan (少年會所), typically translated as “juvenile assembly hall” or “youth club”, which boys enter around the age of 12 or 13 to undergo years of training to become adults. In traditional Puyuma societies boys would only move out of the dakuvan after getting married, but I would imagine things are very different these days. View Image Details A gleaming statue at the site of the future Zhongdao Taitung Buddhist Statue Museum ( 中道台東佛像博物館 ). View Image Details Puyuma assembly hall on the side of the highway in the village of Lanown. This is likely a youth assembly hall. Not long after leaving Lanown behind I arrived at Taitung Station (台東車站). Here I purchased a ticket, did my best to clean up after another sweaty day of riding, and concluded nearly a week of riding down the Huadong Valley of eastern Taiwan , probably around 250 kilometers in all. This final report brings the entire series to approximately 26,000 words and nearly 300 photos. Given the amount of effort required to properly research and describe every point of interest I found along the way it may be quite some time before I publish another series like this one—but I am very grateful for how much I learned along the way. Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed reading about the many natural wonders, historical sites, and cultural features of eastern Taiwan I documented on this epic bicycle trip!

My fifth day of riding the Huadong Valley in 2018 began in Guanshan and ended in Taitung City , approximately 45 kilometers further south. Although there were several uphill segments this was one of the least demanding rides of the entire trip, partly because I had a good night’s rest, but also due to some cloud cover moderating the influence of the tropical sun. After rising I cycled over to Little Star Breakfast shop (小星星早餐店) to try their fluffy handmade dànbǐng 蛋餅 (a crepe-like egg roll with various fillings). Feeling recharged, I set out to catalog more of eastern Taiwan’s historical relics and natural wonders. View Image Details Only the base of a stone lantern remains at the site of the former Shinto shrine in Guanshan. On the western edge of town I went to have a look at what little remains of the former Shinto shrine in Guanshan 1 . Only a stone lantern base remains; the rest was dismantled “after the war” according to popular histories. From my previous investigations of the fates of Shinto shrines in Taiwan it is more likely to have been destroyed following the promulgation of an edict requiring the removal of Japanese imperial relics in 1974 2 . In any case, it was originally constructed in 1928, back when this area was known as Lǐlǒng (里壠; Taiwanese Hokkien : Lí-lāng; a name derived from the Amis language ), hence it was known as Lilong Shrine (里壠社). Plenty of old Japanese colonial buildings bear this same archaic name; the town was only renamed Guanshan in 1937, around when Japanization efforts really began to accelerate 3 . View Image Details The former township administrator’s residence, one of several heritage properties in Guanshan. Heading back into town I breezed by the Lilong Administrator’s Residence (里壠官舍), constructed in 1938 and formally designated a heritage building in 2009 4 . This entire block at the edge of town was purpose-built to house Guanshan’s burgeoning civil administration. Several other wooden dormitories can still be found here—one of which contains the Guanshan Police Museum (關山警察史跡文物館), which is open to the public at certain hours (though you’ll have to request entry from the modern police station out front). View Image Details One of several Japanese colonial era dormitories next to the police station. Some of these are still in use as residences for active duty officers! View Image Details An old telephone switchboard inside the Guanshan Police Museum. View Image Details Inside the Guanshan Police Museum. View Image Details Relics of the Sancha Mountain Incident. The police museum provided a welcome 15 minute respite from the strengthening sun. Most of the artifacts inside were self-explanatory, but several related to an incredible story that I had to look up after the fact (there being little in the way of English on the informational plaques of this small town museum). In September 1945, not long after the Japanese surrender , a converted B-24 Liberator carrying recently released prisoners of war crashed into the mountains west of Guanshan, killing all 26 crew and passengers on board. They were en route from Okinawa to Manila and ran into rough weather due to Typhoon Ursula, which caused the crash of five other evacuation flights, claiming 120 lives altogether. Bunun hunters in the mountains witnessed the crash and soon informed the police in Guanshan of the location. Japanese colonial police officers, not yet relieved of duty in the pending handover to the Kuomintang (KMT), elected to organize a search and rescue party. An initial group of eight reached the site of the crash after three days of hard climbing and found no survivors, only plane wreckage and bodies scattered everywhere. A second party of 89 men was dispatched a week later to bury the bodies on site—but disaster struck once again, as Typhoon Jean brought torrential rains and high winds to the mountainside, causing another 26 people to perish. These twin disasters came to be known as the Sānchā Mountain Incident ( 三叉山事件 ) 5 . View Image Details A derelict theater in central Guanshan. Guanshan now has fewer than 10,000 residents but was home to several movie theaters in the booming years of the 1970s. Most of these cinemas have already been demolished but the hulking ruin of Zhōnghuá Theater (中華大戲院) remains intact, hidden down a small laneway not far from the front of the railway station. It opened in 1965 and enjoyed a 20 year run, closing its doors in 1985. It was by far the most interesting site I visited on this day of riding—so be sure to check out the full post for more. View Image Details An oblique view of the former Guanshan Station. Old Guanshan Station ( 關山舊車站 ) is another landmark with official heritage status. Constructed in 1922, this wooden railway station was in use until it was decommissioned in 1980, part of the modernization of the Taitung Line ( 臺東線 ). Nowadays it enjoys a second life as a cyclist rest stop, emblazoned with the original Japanese name (里壠驛) over the entrance. View Image Details Looking north along the raised embankment of the former railway line south of Guanshan Station. Heading south out of town I was interested in locating the former railway line, abolished during the Hualien-Taitung Line Electrification Project in 2013. The raised embankment of the former line is readily visible on satellite maps, so it was just a matter of finding an access point to take a closer look. Eventually I found a small path and climbed a short distance to take a photo of the empty track bed . Turning around, I noticed a bike path stretching southward toward the horizon. Entirely by accident I had found the newly constructed Guanshan-Yuèméi Bikeway (關山月眉自行車道), which might not have officially opened to the public at that time 6 . View Image Details Riding south along the scenic Guanshan-Yuemei Bike Path, perched on top of a former railway line. View Image Details On the former platform at the derelict Yuemei Station. View Image Details Inside the abolished railway station. Nothing much to see here, just ruin and decay. My next stop was the derelict Yuèměi Station ( 月美車站 ), abolished in 2013 along with the rest of this curved stretch of railway line. If you’ve been paying really close attention you might have detected what appears to be a typo—but the name of the station and the surrounding village (and hence the bike path) are not the same! In an interesting twist, Yuemei station was renamed to use an alternate mei in 1963 after a short-lived conflict with a station of the same name on a sugar railway line extending from Houli to Dajia in Taichung—with a stop at Yuèméi Sugar Factory ( 月眉糖廠 ). In any case, there wasn’t much to see at eastern Taiwan’s dilapidated Yuemei Station, so I stopped for a quick photo of my bicycle and panniers on the platform and kept moving. View Image Details A rural scrapyard next to the bikeway. View Image Details The dry and dusty Jialu River. Most of the rivers of eastern Taiwan look something like this during the early spring drought. Beyond Yuemei I rejoined Provincial Highway 9 , the main thoroughfare running along the Huadong Valley, and crossed the Jiālù River (加鹿溪). A second river crossing delivered me into Luye , the next township south of Guanshan, and Jǐngfēng Village (景豐村), where I spied the telltale sign of tobacco barns 7 , readily identified by angled ventilation complexes protruding from the rooftops. Tobacco was cultivated in many areas of the Huadong Valley throughout the mid-20th century, and derelict tobacco barns can often be found in sleepy agrarian settlements like this one.

Heading east on Ruìjǐng Road (瑞景路), I cruised through the farming villages of Ruìhé (瑞和) and Ruìyuán (瑞源). Along the way I chanced upon an old Japanese dormitory with ceramic knob-and-tube wiring that I haven’t been able to properly identify, though it may have been used as a school or kindergarten prior to abandonment; Fúmíng Temple (福明宮), which venerates Shénnóng (神農), the god of farming; and a humble Hakka restaurant by the name of 200哩板條, where I stopped for a tasty bowl of noodles. View Image Details One of the main tourist attractions in this part of Luye is a pink aqueduct snaking across the countryside. Prior to moving on I made a brief detour to check out the Èrcéngpíng Aqueduct (二層坪水橋), a scenic attraction prominently displayed on road signs throughout the area. A quick search suggests it has become quite popular on social media—especially when the surrounding fields are in bloom. The aqueduct was completed in 2016 to provide irrigation water to an elevated plateau southeast of the village, replacing a dilapidated channel constructed with stone and cement. The landscape of the southern Huadong Valley is a jumble of fluvial terraces at different elevations, necessitating such infrastructure. View Image Details The former railway bridge crossing the Lùliáo River ( 鹿寮溪 ) into central Luye. View Image Details Cyclists setting out from Luye Station for a nice afternoon of riding. View Image Details The authoritarian modernism of the Luye Area Farmers’ Association ( 鹿野地區農會 ). Five kilometers south of the aqueduct I arrived at the front of Luye Station (鹿野車站), where several other cyclists were disembarking for an afternoon ride. The town itself is tiny—just a line of buildings along the highway sandwiched between Beinan River (卑南溪) and the rugged hills leading up to the Luye Highlands (鹿野高台), home of the Taiwan International Balloon Festival . Beyond the station I ascended an access road leading to a plateau just south of the highlands—the former site of the Japanese immigrant village after which Luye is named. View Image Details A pineapple farm on the plateau above Luye Station. If you didn’t already know pineapples grow on the ground, now you do! Luye Immigrant Village (鹿野移民村) was established in 1915, part of an early wave of ethnic Japanese settlement in eastern Taiwan 8 . Initially Japanese farmers only came on short-term contracts, arriving in wintertime to cultivate sugarcane for the Taitung Sugar Company (台東製糖株式會社), but after 1917 many immigrants remained year-round. The population fluctuated wildly over the decades, from a peak of around 1,500 to 2,000 residents, to a low of only a few hundred 9 , presumably due to employment opportunities and macroeconomic conditions, among other factors. Not much remains from those days apart from the “chessboard” street layout and the location of schools and other civic structures, but the Luye District Administration Office (鹿野區役場), dating back to 1921, preserves much of its former appearance, along with a handful of residences scattered throughout the village. View Image Details The original Japanese colonial era administration office, now open to the public. More than half a million ethnic Japanese were repatriated following the war, the vast majority of them departing by ship from Keelung beginning in March 1946, and continuing for the next several months 10 . The settlement, previously an exclusive Japanese domain, was repopulated by Han Taiwanese from the surrounding area, and renamed Lóngtián Village (龍田村). The new residents took up where the old ones left off, cultivating sugarcane and other cash crops 11 . Nowadays their main agricultural product is pineapple, as indicated by several works of public art on display along the highway, but tourism is beginning to reshape this scenic village. View Image Details This is pineapple country. In 2012 township officials, with the assistance of the Huadong Valley tourism development association 12 , advanced a proposal to rebuild Luye Shinto Shrine (鹿野神社), which dates back to 1931 13 . The idea was not without controversy—after all, State Shinto was imposed on Taiwanese society, and it is closely linked with Japanese imperialism and militarism 14 . Wary of appearing to glorify a violent colonial past, government officials planned for the shrine to be only a reproduction, enshrining no kami and avoiding any religious ceremonies at the site. View Image Details The newly reconstructed Luye Shinto Shrine at the north end of the former Japanese immigrant village. Notice the paraglider soaring between the crossbeams of the torii? View Image Details The newly-built shrine is situated on the original stone pedestal with the Luye Highlands in the background. View Image Details Although it was completed in 2015 the shrine already shows signs of wear. After securing the approval of all stakeholders, the regional tourist development association commissioned a pair of miyadaikum (宮大工, master carpenters) from Japan to reconstruct the honden (本殿) and torii (鳥居) from archival photographs, substituting imported Japanese cypress for the original Taiwanese red cypress 15 . Taiwanese landscape architect Guō Zhōngduān (郭中端), founder of Laboratory for Environment & Form (中冶環境造形顧問有限公司), also came on board to reshape the surrounding area and transform it into a proper attraction. It officially opened to the public in October 2015, making it only the third Shinto shrine in Taiwan to be completely rebuilt after the war 16 . View Image Details The last crossroads prior to entering Beinan Township. A late afternoon haze settled over the valley as I continued along Provincial Highway 9, following its twists and turns into Beinan , the rural township surrounding the central core of Taitung’s administrative capital. I breezed through the northern part of the township, home of Chulu Ranch (初鹿牧場), famous for its fresh milk, without seeing much of interest. A roadside fruit vendors with a huge sugar apple ( Annona squamosa ) statue caught my eye, as did an ugly half-finished townhome complex. Here I ascended to the rooftop to capture the southern end of the Huadong Valley, where the Coastal Mountain Range slides beneath the surface, and the vast Pacific Ocean beyond.

View Image Details The former Binlang Station in Beinan Township. Dusk gathered and lighting conditions became increasingly unfavorable for photography, prompting me to make fewer stops. I still took some time out to swing by Old Bīnláng Station ( 檳榔車站 ), a nondescript wooden station dating back to 1922. Prior to major upgrades the Taitung Line ( 臺東線 ) ran through this part of the township, but this station (along with several others in the area) were abolished in 1982 when a more direct line from Luye to Taitung City was completed. Naturally I made a point of photographing a betel nut booth here in Binlang Village (檳榔村). View Image Details One of many megaliths in this part of Taiwan, and perhaps the most recognizable: the Crescent Moon Stone. Prior to arriving in central Taitung City I made one last stop at the Crescent Moon Stone (月形石柱), a famous megalith standing near the entrance of Beinan Cultural Park (卑南文化公園), site of the largest known prehistoric settlement in Taiwan 17 . This standing stone was one of many documented by Japanese anthropologist Torii Ryūzō (鳥居龍藏) in 1896—and again in the 1920s by naturalist Tadao Kano ( 鹿野忠雄 ). Although you might expect this stone to have a religious function, it is generally accepted that such stones were structural components, likely of residences—and the crescent cut-out would have once supported a wooden beam. Whatever the case, it was still an impressive sight, and a nice way to wrap up this multi-day ride down the valley. View Image Details Rice noodle soup at Laodongtai. View Image Details A curious sight: busking inside a Taitung restaurant. After checking into one of my usual hotels in central Taitung I went out for my customary bowl of silver needle noodles (米苔目; pinyin: mǐtáimù), a pudgy rice noodle typically served in soup with a somewhat fishy broth, at the famous old shop Lǎodōngtái (老東台). For reasons I have been unable to divine, mitaimu is closely associated with Taitung cuisine in the minds of most Taiwanese, although the dish did not originate here. In a somewhat surreal twist, a foreigner walked in during my meal and began busking inside the restaurant, which is a highly unusual occurrence in Taiwan. Thus ends my last full day of riding on this particular road trip. I’ll return with an epilogue consisting of a short tour of the surrounding plains on the way to the train station. In the meantime, be sure to catch up with the previous day’s exploits if you haven’t already done so. More about the Lilong Shrine can be found here and here . ↩ I go into much greater detail about the geopolitical context of this edict in this post about the Suhua Highway . For whatever reason the exact date and reason for a Shinto shrine’s destruction is often glossed over, so it’s not easy to pinpoint exactly when it happened. ↩ This change of names occurs alongside the advent of the Kōminka Movement ( 皇民化運動 ), an aggressive policy of language suppression and further integration into Imperial Japan, as well as the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War . Although I wasn’t able to substantiate the exact reason for the change of names it wouldn’t be at all surprising if the Japanese authorities found the existing name too Taiwanese. ↩ More information about the Lilong Administrator’s Residence can be found here . ↩ Much more about this neglected piece of history can be found on Michael Turton’s blog (although all the onward links are dead). This CNA news story describes a more recent trip to the site of the crash, where wreckage and signs of the search and rescue efforts can still be found. ↩ This post from a Taiwanese blogger is similarly confused about the lack of authoritative information about the Guanshan-Yuemei Bike Path. It is especially peculiar given how well the government promotes the Guanshan Circular Bikeway ( 關山環鎮自行車道 ), apparently the first recreational bike path in Taiwan. ↩ I have written at length about tobacco barns (菸樓) and the tobacco industry of Taiwan . If you’re curious to read more about how they operated, refer back to this post from my second day of riding. ↩ Previously this plateau was mainly used as hunting grounds by the Indigenous people of the area, who valued its rich stock of wild boar and sika deer . It seems likely this is how Luye, or Shikano in the original Japanese, got its name—it literally means “deer wilderness”. And yes, the “shika” in the name and “sika”, as in the type of deer, have a common origin in the kun’yomi reading of the kanji for “deer”. ↩ By some accounts Luye was the largest Japanese immigrant village in Taitung County, but there were only a handful of others here at the southern end of the valley. One was situated just north of the highlands, also in Luye, and several more could be found on the plains west of Taitung City. Note: some of the population figures are derived from this post about the Luye Shinto Shrine. ↩ Many of those ethnic Japanese forced to repatriate to Japan were born here and had never left Taiwan. This displaced generation is known as the wansei , literally “Taiwan-born”. Several dates and figures in this section are taken from When Empire Comes Home: Repatriation and Reintegration in Postwar Japan by Lori Watt. This article in the Japan Times describes the experience of one particular family repatriated from Guanshan, where this day’s ride began. ↩ Taitung Sugar Factory officially closed in 1996, and it’s fair to assume sugarcane cultivation in the valley was already on the decline by that time. ↩ Many of the details in this section are derived from a Japanese language article, A Case Study of Rebuilding of Shrine built in Taiwan Under Japanese Rule , by Noguchi Eisuke. The author suggests that Chén Chóngxián (陳崇賢), director of the Huadong Rift Valley National Scenic Area Management Office (花東縱谷國家風景區管理處), was the main driver of this ambitious project, laying the groundwork and getting stakeholders on board before adeptly allowing local politicians take credit for the idea. Chen had previously worked on the Hatta Yoichi Memorial Park ( 八田與一紀念公園 ) in Chiayi and was motivated to develop attractions in eastern Taiwan specifically for the Japanese tourist market. ↩ Luye Shinto Shrine was originally constructed in the early 1920s before moving to its current location in 1931. Following the war the honden was transformed into an altar for Tǔdìgōng (土地公), generally known as the Land God, and it remained the center of worship for the community until the establishment of Kūncí Temple ( 崑慈堂 ) next to the shrine. Sometime after the promulgation of the aforementioned 1974 edict the former shrine was reduced to only the pedestal and a pair of stone lanterns.

My fifth day of riding the Huadong Valley in 2018 began in Guanshan and ended in Taitung City , approximately 45 kilometers further south. Although there were several uphill segments this was one of the least demanding rides of the entire trip, partly because I had a good night’s rest, but also due to some cloud cover moderating the influence of the tropical sun. After rising I cycled over to Little Star Breakfast shop (小星星早餐店) to try their fluffy handmade dànbǐng 蛋餅 (a crepe-like egg roll with various fillings). Feeling recharged, I set out to catalog more of eastern Taiwan’s historical relics and natural wonders. View Image Details Only the base of a stone lantern remains at the site of the former Shinto shrine in Guanshan. On the western edge of town I went to have a look at what little remains of the former Shinto shrine in Guanshan 1 . Only a stone lantern base remains; the rest was dismantled “after the war” according to popular histories. From my previous investigations of the fates of Shinto shrines in Taiwan it is more likely to have been destroyed following the promulgation of an edict requiring the removal of Japanese imperial relics in 1974 2 . In any case, it was originally constructed in 1928, back when this area was known as Lǐlǒng (里壠; Taiwanese Hokkien : Lí-lāng; a name derived from the Amis language ), hence it was known as Lilong Shrine (里壠社). Plenty of old Japanese colonial buildings bear this same archaic name; the town was only renamed Guanshan in 1937, around when Japanization efforts really began to accelerate 3 . View Image Details The former township administrator’s residence, one of several heritage properties in Guanshan. Heading back into town I breezed by the Lilong Administrator’s Residence (里壠官舍), constructed in 1938 and formally designated a heritage building in 2009 4 . This entire block at the edge of town was purpose-built to house Guanshan’s burgeoning civil administration. Several other wooden dormitories can still be found here—one of which contains the Guanshan Police Museum (關山警察史跡文物館), which is open to the public at certain hours (though you’ll have to request entry from the modern police station out front). View Image Details One of several Japanese colonial era dormitories next to the police station. Some of these are still in use as residences for active duty officers! View Image Details An old telephone switchboard inside the Guanshan Police Museum. View Image Details Inside the Guanshan Police Museum. View Image Details Relics of the Sancha Mountain Incident. The police museum provided a welcome 15 minute respite from the strengthening sun. Most of the artifacts inside were self-explanatory, but several related to an incredible story that I had to look up after the fact (there being little in the way of English on the informational plaques of this small town museum). In September 1945, not long after the Japanese surrender , a converted B-24 Liberator carrying recently released prisoners of war crashed into the mountains west of Guanshan, killing all 26 crew and passengers on board. They were en route from Okinawa to Manila and ran into rough weather due to Typhoon Ursula, which caused the crash of five other evacuation flights, claiming 120 lives altogether. Bunun hunters in the mountains witnessed the crash and soon informed the police in Guanshan of the location. Japanese colonial police officers, not yet relieved of duty in the pending handover to the Kuomintang (KMT), elected to organize a search and rescue party. An initial group of eight reached the site of the crash after three days of hard climbing and found no survivors, only plane wreckage and bodies scattered everywhere. A second party of 89 men was dispatched a week later to bury the bodies on site—but disaster struck once again, as Typhoon Jean brought torrential rains and high winds to the mountainside, causing another 26 people to perish. These twin disasters came to be known as the Sānchā Mountain Incident ( 三叉山事件 ) 5 . View Image Details A derelict theater in central Guanshan. Guanshan now has fewer than 10,000 residents but was home to several movie theaters in the booming years of the 1970s. Most of these cinemas have already been demolished but the hulking ruin of Zhōnghuá Theater (中華大戲院) remains intact, hidden down a small laneway not far from the front of the railway station. It opened in 1965 and enjoyed a 20 year run, closing its doors in 1985. It was by far the most interesting site I visited on this day of riding—so be sure to check out the full post for more. View Image Details An oblique view of the former Guanshan Station. Old Guanshan Station ( 關山舊車站 ) is another landmark with official heritage status. Constructed in 1922, this wooden railway station was in use until it was decommissioned in 1980, part of the modernization of the Taitung Line ( 臺東線 ). Nowadays it enjoys a second life as a cyclist rest stop, emblazoned with the original Japanese name (里壠驛) over the entrance. View Image Details Looking north along the raised embankment of the former railway line south of Guanshan Station. Heading south out of town I was interested in locating the former railway line, abolished during the Hualien-Taitung Line Electrification Project in 2013. The raised embankment of the former line is readily visible on satellite maps, so it was just a matter of finding an access point to take a closer look. Eventually I found a small path and climbed a short distance to take a photo of the empty track bed . Turning around, I noticed a bike path stretching southward toward the horizon. Entirely by accident I had found the newly constructed Guanshan-Yuèméi Bikeway (關山月眉自行車道), which might not have officially opened to the public at that time 6 . View Image Details Riding south along the scenic Guanshan-Yuemei Bike Path, perched on top of a former railway line. View Image Details On the former platform at the derelict Yuemei Station. View Image Details Inside the abolished railway station. Nothing much to see here, just ruin and decay. My next stop was the derelict Yuèměi Station ( 月美車站 ), abolished in 2013 along with the rest of this curved stretch of railway line. If you’ve been paying really close attention you might have detected what appears to be a typo—but the name of the station and the surrounding village (and hence the bike path) are not the same! In an interesting twist, Yuemei station was renamed to use an alternate mei in 1963 after a short-lived conflict with a station of the same name on a sugar railway line extending from Houli to Dajia in Taichung—with a stop at Yuèméi Sugar Factory ( 月眉糖廠 ). In any case, there wasn’t much to see at eastern Taiwan’s dilapidated Yuemei Station, so I stopped for a quick photo of my bicycle and panniers on the platform and kept moving. View Image Details A rural scrapyard next to the bikeway. View Image Details The dry and dusty Jialu River. Most of the rivers of eastern Taiwan look something like this during the early spring drought. Beyond Yuemei I rejoined Provincial Highway 9 , the main thoroughfare running along the Huadong Valley, and crossed the Jiālù River (加鹿溪). A second river crossing delivered me into Luye , the next township south of Guanshan, and Jǐngfēng Village (景豐村), where I spied the telltale sign of tobacco barns 7 , readily identified by angled ventilation complexes protruding from the rooftops. Tobacco was cultivated in many areas of the Huadong Valley throughout the mid-20th century, and derelict tobacco barns can often be found in sleepy agrarian settlements like this one. View Image Details An idle tobacco barn in Jingfeng Village. View Image Details The Taroko Express ( 太魯閣號 ) heading northbound through Luye Township. View Image Details A decaying Japanese dormitory in Ruiyuan, purpose unknown. View Image Details A juice shop in Ruiyuan with a commanding slogan. View Image Details Shennong presiding over a small temple in rural Ruiyuan. View Image Details Simple Hakka noodles for lunch in Ruiyuan. Heading east on Ruìjǐng Road (瑞景路), I cruised through the farming villages of Ruìhé (瑞和) and Ruìyuán (瑞源). Along the way I chanced upon an old Japanese dormitory with ceramic knob-and-tube wiring that I haven’t been able to properly identify, though it may have been used as a school or kindergarten prior to abandonment; Fúmíng Temple (福明宮), which venerates Shénnóng (神農), the god of farming; and a humble Hakka restaurant by the name of 200哩板條, where I stopped for a tasty bowl of noodles. View Image Details One of the main tourist attractions in this part of Luye is a pink aqueduct snaking across the countryside. Prior to moving on I made a brief detour to check out the Èrcéngpíng Aqueduct (二層坪水橋), a scenic attraction prominently displayed on road signs throughout the area. A quick search suggests it has become quite popular on social media—especially when the surrounding fields are in bloom. The aqueduct was completed in 2016 to provide irrigation water to an elevated plateau southeast of the village, replacing a dilapidated channel constructed with stone and cement. The landscape of the southern Huadong Valley is a jumble of fluvial terraces at different elevations, necessitating such infrastructure. View Image Details The former railway bridge crossing the Lùliáo River ( 鹿寮溪 ) into central Luye. View Image Details Cyclists setting out from Luye Station for a nice afternoon of riding. View Image Details The authoritarian modernism of the Luye Area Farmers’ Association ( 鹿野地區農會 ). Five kilometers south of the aqueduct I arrived at the front of Luye Station (鹿野車站), where several other cyclists were disembarking for an afternoon ride. The town itself is tiny—just a line of buildings along the highway sandwiched between Beinan River (卑南溪) and the rugged hills leading up to the Luye Highlands (鹿野高台), home of the Taiwan International Balloon Festival . Beyond the station I ascended an access road leading to a plateau just south of the highlands—the former site of the Japanese immigrant village after which Luye is named. View Image Details A pineapple farm on the plateau above Luye Station. If you didn’t already know pineapples grow on the ground, now you do! Luye Immigrant Village (鹿野移民村) was established in 1915, part of an early wave of ethnic Japanese settlement in eastern Taiwan 8 . Initially Japanese farmers only came on short-term contracts, arriving in wintertime to cultivate sugarcane for the Taitung Sugar Company (台東製糖株式會社), but after 1917 many immigrants remained year-round. The population fluctuated wildly over the decades, from a peak of around 1,500 to 2,000 residents, to a low of only a few hundred 9 , presumably due to employment opportunities and macroeconomic conditions, among other factors. Not much remains from those days apart from the “chessboard” street layout and the location of schools and other civic structures, but the Luye District Administration Office (鹿野區役場), dating back to 1921, preserves much of its former appearance, along with a handful of residences scattered throughout the village. View Image Details The original Japanese colonial era administration office, now open to the public. More than half a million ethnic Japanese were repatriated following the war, the vast majority of them departing by ship from Keelung beginning in March 1946, and continuing for the next several months 10 . The settlement, previously an exclusive Japanese domain, was repopulated by Han Taiwanese from the surrounding area, and renamed Lóngtián Village (龍田村). The new residents took up where the old ones left off, cultivating sugarcane and other cash crops 11 . Nowadays their main agricultural product is pineapple, as indicated by several works of public art on display along the highway, but tourism is beginning to reshape this scenic village. View Image Details This is pineapple country. In 2012 township officials, with the assistance of the Huadong Valley tourism development association 12 , advanced a proposal to rebuild Luye Shinto Shrine (鹿野神社), which dates back to 1931 13 . The idea was not without controversy—after all, State Shinto was imposed on Taiwanese society, and it is closely linked with Japanese imperialism and militarism 14 . Wary of appearing to glorify a violent colonial past, government officials planned for the shrine to be only a reproduction, enshrining no kami and avoiding any religious ceremonies at the site. View Image Details The newly reconstructed Luye Shinto Shrine at the north end of the former Japanese immigrant village. Notice the paraglider soaring between the crossbeams of the torii? View Image Details The newly-built shrine is situated on the original stone pedestal with the Luye Highlands in the background. View Image Details Although it was completed in 2015 the shrine already shows signs of wear. After securing the approval of all stakeholders, the regional tourist development association commissioned a pair of miyadaikum (宮大工, master carpenters) from Japan to reconstruct the honden (本殿) and torii (鳥居) from archival photographs, substituting imported Japanese cypress for the original Taiwanese red cypress 15 . Taiwanese landscape architect Guō Zhōngduān (郭中端), founder of Laboratory for Environment & Form (中冶環境造形顧問有限公司), also came on board to reshape the surrounding area and transform it into a proper attraction. It officially opened to the public in October 2015, making it only the third Shinto shrine in Taiwan to be completely rebuilt after the war 16 . View Image Details The last crossroads prior to entering Beinan Township. A late afternoon haze settled over the valley as I continued along Provincial Highway 9, following its twists and turns into Beinan , the rural township surrounding the central core of Taitung’s administrative capital. I breezed through the northern part of the township, home of Chulu Ranch (初鹿牧場), famous for its fresh milk, without seeing much of interest. A roadside fruit vendors with a huge sugar apple ( Annona squamosa ) statue caught my eye, as did an ugly half-finished townhome complex. Here I ascended to the rooftop to capture the southern end of the Huadong Valley, where the Coastal Mountain Range slides beneath the surface, and the vast Pacific Ocean beyond. View Image Details A sugar apple vendor by the roadside on Provincial Highway 9. View Image Details A derelict apartment block on the way to Taitung City. View Image Details The southern end of the Huadong Valley from the top of an unfinished apartment complex. View Image Details A betel nut vendor in Binlang Village. View Image Details The former Binlang Station in Beinan Township. Dusk gathered and lighting conditions became increasingly unfavorable for photography, prompting me to make fewer stops. I still took some time out to swing by Old Bīnláng Station ( 檳榔車站 ), a nondescript wooden station dating back to 1922. Prior to major upgrades the Taitung Line ( 臺東線 ) ran through this part of the township, but this station (along with several others in the area) were abolished in 1982 when a more direct line from Luye to Taitung City was completed. Naturally I made a point of photographing a betel nut booth here in Binlang Village (檳榔村). View Image Details One of many megaliths in this part of Taiwan, and perhaps the most recognizable: the Crescent Moon Stone. Prior to arriving in central Taitung City I made one last stop at the Crescent Moon Stone (月形石柱), a famous megalith standing near the entrance of Beinan Cultural Park (卑南文化公園), site of the largest known prehistoric settlement in Taiwan 17 . This standing stone was one of many documented by Japanese anthropologist Torii Ryūzō (鳥居龍藏) in 1896—and again in the 1920s by naturalist Tadao Kano ( 鹿野忠雄 ). Although you might expect this stone to have a religious function, it is generally accepted that such stones were structural components, likely of residences—and the crescent cut-out would have once supported a wooden beam. Whatever the case, it was still an impressive sight, and a nice way to wrap up this multi-day ride down the valley. View Image Details Rice noodle soup at Laodongtai. View Image Details A curious sight: busking inside a Taitung restaurant. After checking into one of my usual hotels in central Taitung I went out for my customary bowl of silver needle noodles (米苔目; pinyin: mǐtáimù), a pudgy rice noodle typically served in soup with a somewhat fishy broth, at the famous old shop Lǎodōngtái (老東台). For reasons I have been unable to divine, mitaimu is closely associated with Taitung cuisine in the minds of most Taiwanese, although the dish did not originate here. In a somewhat surreal twist, a foreigner walked in during my meal and began busking inside the restaurant, which is a highly unusual occurrence in Taiwan. Thus ends my last full day of riding on this particular road trip. I’ll return with an epilogue consisting of a short tour of the surrounding plains on the way to the train station. In the meantime, be sure to catch up with the previous day’s exploits if you haven’t already done so. More about the Lilong Shrine can be found here and here . ↩ I go into much greater detail about the geopolitical context of this edict in this post about the Suhua Highway . For whatever reason the exact date and reason for a Shinto shrine’s destruction is often glossed over, so it’s not easy to pinpoint exactly when it happened. ↩ This change of names occurs alongside the advent of the Kōminka Movement ( 皇民化運動 ), an aggressive policy of language suppression and further integration into Imperial Japan, as well as the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War . Although I wasn’t able to substantiate the exact reason for the change of names it wouldn’t be at all surprising if the Japanese authorities found the existing name too Taiwanese. ↩ More information about the Lilong Administrator’s Residence can be found here . ↩ Much more about this neglected piece of history can be found on Michael Turton’s blog (although all the onward links are dead). This CNA news story describes a more recent trip to the site of the crash, where wreckage and signs of the search and rescue efforts can still be found. ↩ This post from a Taiwanese blogger is similarly confused about the lack of authoritative information about the Guanshan-Yuemei Bike Path. It is especially peculiar given how well the government promotes the Guanshan Circular Bikeway ( 關山環鎮自行車道 ), apparently the first recreational bike path in Taiwan. ↩ I have written at length about tobacco barns (菸樓) and the tobacco industry of Taiwan . If you’re curious to read more about how they operated, refer back to this post from my second day of riding. ↩ Previously this plateau was mainly used as hunting grounds by the Indigenous people of the area, who valued its rich stock of wild boar and sika deer . It seems likely this is how Luye, or Shikano in the original Japanese, got its name—it literally means “deer wilderness”. And yes, the “shika” in the name and “sika”, as in the type of deer, have a common origin in the kun’yomi reading of the kanji for “deer”. ↩ By some accounts Luye was the largest Japanese immigrant village in Taitung County, but there were only a handful of others here at the southern end of the valley. One was situated just north of the highlands, also in Luye, and several more could be found on the plains west of Taitung City. Note: some of the population figures are derived from this post about the Luye Shinto Shrine. ↩ Many of those ethnic Japanese forced to repatriate to Japan were born here and had never left Taiwan. This displaced generation is known as the wansei , literally “Taiwan-born”. Several dates and figures in this section are taken from When Empire Comes Home: Repatriation and Reintegration in Postwar Japan by Lori Watt. This article in the Japan Times describes the experience of one particular family repatriated from Guanshan, where this day’s ride began. ↩ Taitung Sugar Factory officially closed in 1996, and it’s fair to assume sugarcane cultivation in the valley was already on the decline by that time. ↩ Many of the details in this section are derived from a Japanese language article, A Case Study of Rebuilding of Shrine built in Taiwan Under Japanese Rule , by Noguchi Eisuke. The author suggests that Chén Chóngxián (陳崇賢), director of the Huadong Rift Valley National Scenic Area Management Office (花東縱谷國家風景區管理處), was the main driver of this ambitious project, laying the groundwork and getting stakeholders on board before adeptly allowing local politicians take credit for the idea. Chen had previously worked on the Hatta Yoichi Memorial Park ( 八田與一紀念公園 ) in Chiayi and was motivated to develop attractions in eastern Taiwan specifically for the Japanese tourist market. ↩ Luye Shinto Shrine was originally constructed in the early 1920s before moving to its current location in 1931.

Shigang Rice Barn 石岡穀倉, formally known as the Shigang Farmers’ Association Rice Milling Barn 石岡農會碾米穀倉, is one of the best preserved Japanese colonial era rice barns in Taiwan . Constructed with locally-sourced timber in 1941, it was designed to be earthquake-resistant, benefitting from hard lessons learned from the 1923 Great Kantō Earthquake and the 1935 Hsinchu-Taichung Earthquake . It was in use for many decades before modernization of rice milling made it obsolete, presumably sometime in the 1980s or 1990s, leaving the building derelict and threatened with demolition. View Image Details A historic rice barn in Shigang, Taichung, from across the street. View Image Details Oblique view of the old rice mill.

In the aftermath of the disaster the central government dispensed relief funds—so the local agricultural cooperative opted to properly restore the structure and transform it into a tourist attraction. It was awarded heritage status in 2002 and is now open to the public. Entry is free of charge and guided tours can be scheduled in advance. View Image Details Inside the rice milling area.

Jīnchéng Theater 金城戲院 is located in Mailiao , a rural township in northwestern Yunlin , Taiwan . This theater is something of a cypher; it was reputedly built in 1965, but may have only opened in 1968 , and business records record only one transaction in 1975. It probably closed in the late 1980s or very early 1990s, a casualty of changing consumer habits and population outflow to larger urban centers. Beyond that, not much is known about this hulking monster of a theater, which may have accommodated something like 800 patrons at its peak. View Image Details The functional facade of Jincheng Theater from an laneway at the back of Mailiao’s traditional morning market. View Image Details The front entrance to the old theater. Little effort has been made to prevent access to this hulking ruin. View Image Details The former ticket booth at Jincheng Theater features separate pricing for veterans and an advertisement for various Uni-President brand drinks. The absence of information about Jincheng Theater is somewhat peculiar given its notoriety among urban exploration and vintage photography aficionados in Taiwan 1 . The location is somewhat remote, in the blighted industrial sprawl of coastal Yunlin, but it is readily found on Google Maps—with 18 reviews (“remember to bring long pants and insect repellent”, one says) and an average rating of 3.9. Gaining access is also effortless; the door is usually wide open and nobody minds if you waltz right in. Despite being well-known there is no large-scale vandalism of the interior, making this an easy and rewarding exploration for novices and more seasoned adventurers alike. View Image Details Many of the original wooden seats have deteriorated into mulch but the silver screen remains serene on stage. View Image Details A sidelong view of the wooden stage.

Jīnchéng Theater 金城戲院 is located in Mailiao , a rural township in northwestern Yunlin , Taiwan . This theater is something of a cypher; it was reputedly built in 1965, but may have only opened in 1968 , and business records record only one transaction in 1975. It probably closed in the late 1980s or very early 1990s, a casualty of changing consumer habits and population outflow to larger urban centers. Beyond that, not much is known about this hulking monster of a theater, which may have accommodated something like 800 patrons at its peak. View Image Details The functional facade of Jincheng Theater from an laneway at the back of Mailiao’s traditional morning market. View Image Details The front entrance to the old theater. Little effort has been made to prevent access to this hulking ruin. View Image Details The former ticket booth at Jincheng Theater features separate pricing for veterans and an advertisement for various Uni-President brand drinks. The absence of information about Jincheng Theater is somewhat peculiar given its notoriety among urban exploration and vintage photography aficionados in Taiwan 1 . The location is somewhat remote, in the blighted industrial sprawl of coastal Yunlin, but it is readily found on Google Maps—with 18 reviews (“remember to bring long pants and insect repellent”, one says) and an average rating of 3.9. Gaining access is also effortless; the door is usually wide open and nobody minds if you waltz right in. Despite being well-known there is no large-scale vandalism of the interior, making this an easy and rewarding exploration for novices and more seasoned adventurers alike.

Jiànxīn Theater (建新大戲院) is located in Yuánshùlín ( 員樹林 ), a suburban area on the western outskirts of Daxi in Taoyuan , Taiwan . Business records indicate an inception date of 1977, but not much is known about this theater apart from that. The last recorded transaction in 2000 sets an upper bound on when it was operating, but likely went out of business in the early 1990s, when most of the rest of Taiwan’s cinema industry collapsed. It now enjoys a second life as a parking garage for the nearby factories and residences. View Image Details A glimpse of an old movie theater from the main road running through Yuanshulin. Aside from business records, I found no other references to this obscure theater prior to my visit in January 2020. Mere months later, The Thief of Places published an insightful article about Yuanshulin , suggesting the establishment of the nearby Zhōngzhènglǐng Campus (中正嶺校區) of the National Defense University (國防大學) in 1968 explains the presence of a theater in this somewhat unusual spot, far from the old entertainment district in Daxi 1 . This hypothesis checks out; the thousands of soldiers stationed in the area would have yearned for some form of entertainment in their downtime, and while there probably would have been a cinema on campus, there almost certainly would have been some demand for alternatives to military programming 2 .

View Image Details The purely functional facade of Jianxin Theater belies its origins as a country cinema constructed to serve soldiers at a nearby military base.

A metal frame mounted on the front of the theater indicates that movie posters would have been displayed—but you’d have to know exactly where to look if you were just wandering by. Nowadays the interior of the theater is used for parking—and spaces are for rent, as noted by a red banner hanging beneath the awning out front. View Image Details A first, hesitant glimpse inside the old theater reveals a completely renovated space converted into a parking garage. View Image Details Nothing remains of the original stage or screen. Initially i wasn’t successful in gaining access to the old theater—nobody was around when I went to inquire at the factory office next door, and seeing as how it obviously wasn’t abandoned I wasn’t about to jump through the window. Just as I was leaving the metal shutters of the automated garage door began to clatter, and after waving my camera around and receiving a polite nod from a passing employee, I ducked inside for a quick look around. View Image Details A short stairway provides access to the former projection booth. Those staggered holes allowed for the projectors to be aimed correctly. View Image Details An oblique view of the far side of the projection booth reveals a hidden icon. The interior of the theater has been mostly stripped—and nothing remains of the former stage or screen. Similarly, there was no evidence of any ticket booth or snack bar; everything on the ground floor had been cleared to accommodate automobiles.

View Image Details Inside the projection room, which is now empty of almost all artifacts. Love notes decorate the walls. Ultimately there’s nothing too special about this utilitarian countryside theater, but I’m always glad to add another site to my ever-growing collection of vintage Taiwanese cinemas.

Daxi proper is perched on a plateau on the east side of this valley whereas Yuanshulin is located to the west. Although not far from each other by line of sight, coming down from the escarpment requires quite a detour, adding to travel times. ↩ Military bases in Taiwan were usually built with large halls to accommodate speeches, ceremonies, and other events. These halls, typically named Zhōngzhèng Hall (中正堂) to memorialize former president Chiang Kai-shek , were also used to screen films, albeit of a somewhat more patriotic nature than might be found at privately-owned cinemas. I’m not entirely sure what sort of films were shown at Jianxin Theater but there’s a good chance they specialized in whatever wasn’t being screened on campus. ↩ Since I might not have another opportunity to itemize the former movie theaters of Daxi, here’s what I’ve uncovered: Daxi Theater (大溪戲院), possibly renamed Tiānxiáng Theater (天祥戲院) as some point (or that might have been another theater entirely), both on Zhōngyāng Road (中央路); Fúrén Theater (福仁戲院), named after, but not necessarily located adjecent to, a famous local temple on Hépíng Road (和平路); Guójì Theater (國際戲院) on Kāngzhuāng Road (康莊路), demolished around 2008; and finally Zhōngxìng Theater (中興戲院), another theater located next to a military base far from the center of town. ↩

Day four of riding through the Huadong Valley of eastern Taiwan in 2018 began in Yuli , the midpoint of this bicycle trip from Hualien City to Taitung City . From the weather report I knew I’d have another challenging ride ahead—yet again the mercury was due to exceed 35 degrees. Luckily I was in no great rush, as I had allocated an entire week for a trip that experienced riders could easily manage in two days. I made good use of that extra time, making numerous stops and detours to document some of the many historic and cultural sites along the way, many of them quite obscure. I ended the day in Guanshan , slightly more than 40 kilometers down the valley. View Image Details The view across the central roundabout in Yuli. The oldest cinema in town was once located on the block visible in this photo. My first order of business after a healthy breakfast 1 was to conduct a survey of Yuli’s historic cinemas. The earliest theater in Yuli was likely a multi-purpose performance venue built primarily with wood 2 . Located on the central roundabout, it was eventually replaced with a reinforced concrete structure with seating for 700 patrons, probably in the early 1940s. After the arrival of the Kuomintang (KMT) it was among 19 theaters designated for nationalization—but there appears to be some disagreement about whether it was actually seized along with the others in 1947. It is generally remembered as Tiānshēng Theater (天聲戲院) but was listed as Xīnguāng Theater (新光戲院) in KMT party records 3 . It was demolished long ago. View Image Details This supermarket occupies the site of the former Yushan Theater. A little further east one will find the former site of Yùshān Theater (玉山戲院), likely founded in the 1950s. With a capacity of 865 4 , it was slightly larger than the competition. After it closed sometime in the 1980s or 1990s it was supposedly turned into an arcade. As with the former Ruisui Theater, featured in the previous update , it has now been replaced by an outpost of the Tǒngguān Supermarket (統冠聯合超市, generally written as Tkmart), a chain popular across eastern Taiwan. Whether any part of the original structure remains is unclear. View Image Details The former Yudu Theater under renovation. Only a small part of the vibrant yellow facade remains visible. I was eager to explore the remains of Yùdū Theater (玉都戲院) after finding it in a search of the relevant business records 5 prior to embarking on this road trip, so I was quite disappointed to arrive and find it already undergoing renovations. Founded in 1968 near the front of the train station, it was the largest and most luxurious theater in town when it was built. Only a small part of its distinctive yellow facade could still be seen. From what I know it is now an outpost of the increasingly ubiquitous Poya (寶雅) chain of cosmetic stores. View Image Details A view of the derelict Xinxing Theater from the street. It is located in a residential neighbourhood far removed from the downtown core of Yuli. An old man noticed my interest in Yudu Theater and provided some useful tips about the locations of another theater in town. It was on my list but I hadn’t been able to uncover any details nor locate it on satellite maps—and as soon as I learned where it was, it all made sense. Movie theaters are typically situated near the busiest parts of the commercial centers of small towns like Yuli but Xīnxīng Theater (新興戲院 or 新星戲院) was built in a residential area on the north side of town, far from the action. As with the others it closed sometime in the 1990s, after which it was converted into an auto mechanic shop. It is now abandoned and I did not find any obvious means of entry. View Image Details A former theater converted into an auto mechanic and finally abandoned to to fate. A brief introduction to Yuli, for context: as the largest settlement in the central Huadong Valley it has long been a regional transportation hub. Prior to the arrival of Chinese settlers in the late 19th century the area was inhabited by several Taiwanese Indigenous groups: the Amis people , who called it Posko 6 ; the mountain-dwelling Bunun ; and a variety of Plains Indigenous people who emigrated from western Taiwan beginning in the 19th century (a story elucidated later in this post). The opening of the 152 kilometer-long Bātōngguān Trail (八通關古道) in 1875 7 greatly increased the inflow of Han Chinese settlers, and this trend continued after the arrival of the Japanese, who renamed it Tamazato (literally “Jade Village”, which is where the name Yuli comes from in Mandarin Chinese) in 1920. View Image Details On the visiting path at the former Yuli Shinto Shrine . View Image Details The former Yuli Credit Union, a 1930s reinforced concrete structure with pebble-washed details, now derelict behind a somewhat more modern office of the local farmers’ association. It was designated a heritage property in 2006. Yuli thrived as an administrative center and important market town throughout the Japanese colonial era but few relics remain from those days 8 . Apart from the newly-restored Yuli Shinto Shrine (玉里神社), the subject of a full post on this blog , another example worth mentioning is the reinforced concrete Yuli Credit Union ( 玉里信用組合 ). Completed in 1930, it is located behind the more modern office of the local farmers’ association on the north side of town. It was designated a heritage property in 2006 but it doesn’t seem as if any effort has been made to restore it. View Image Details ROC nationalism on display in north-central Yuli. Many KMT veterans settled here in the 1960s and 1970s and plenty remained after retirement. Eastern Taiwan underwent a population explosion in the 1960s, a consequence of the opening of the Central Cross-Island Highway (中部橫貫公路) and the introduction of numerous government-sponsored development projects employing huge numbers of KMT veterans 9 . Boom turned to bust in the late 1980s as rising wages and policy changes restricting mining and forestry reduced employment opportunities in the valley. At its peak Yuli was probably home to around 50,000 residents, but nowadays fewer than 25,000 remain. Yuli is not alone in experiencing population outflow—the entire valley is hollowing out as people relocate to the bigger cities on the other side of the Central Mountain Range . View Image Details An old bomb shelter located south of the railway station. It isn’t obvious what era this is from, but I’d guess it’s from the 1950s. View Image Details Embarking on the Yuli-Fuli bikeway. This is a former railway bridge converted for the use of cyclists after the main line was rerouted to the west side of the river. View Image Details Plate boundary marker on the bikeway bridge. This is looking north along the valley; the Central Mountain Range is on the left and the Coastal Mountain Range is on the right. I headed south out of town to link up with the scenic Yuli-Fuli Bike Trail ( 玉富自行車道 ). This bikeway follows the former railway line, which jogged eastward across the continental divide. That line was planned in the 1920s, decades prior to the acceptance of plate tectonics theory , so we can excuse the builders for not realizing how much trouble they’d be causing future generations. The convergence rate between the Philippine Sea Plate (to the east) and the Yangtze Plate (part of the larger Eurasian Plate to the west) is 2 or 3 centimeters per year, high enough that the railway authority ended up having to invest considerable time and energy in maintaining the bridges that cross the divide. As such, the entire line was rerouted to the western side of the valley beginning in 1989—and after many years of neglect the former line was converted into the bikeway seen here. View Image Details The entrance to the Halawan settlement just east of central Yuli. View Image Details A reinforced concrete torii marking the entrance to the former Shinto shrine in Halawan. View Image Details An old stone lantern outside a church in Halawan is one of the only remnants of the former Shinto shrine. View Image Details The view from the former Shinto shrine in Halawan. The torii in a previous photo is visible at the bottom left. On the eastern side of the valley I made a small detour into Hālāwān (哈拉灣; Harawan or Harwan in the local tongue), a village nestled into the foothills of the coastal mountains. Halawan is home to a mixed settlement of Amis and the descendants of Plains Indigenous people from southwestern Taiwan. It was also home to a modest Shinto shrine during the Japanese colonial era, but not much remains of this apart from a couple of stone lanterns and a torii renovated in a vaguely indigenous style 10 . View Image Details Antong Station briefly served as a rest station for cyclists but was abandoned by the time I visited in 2018. View Image Details The former platform at Antong Station. The bikeway occupies the former railway bed. Back on the bikeway I breezed by Āntōng Station ( 安通車站 ), originally established in 1924. Antong has long been famous for its hot springs—there’s even an original Japanese onsen in the hills beyond the station. This was also the western terminus of the Antong Traversing Trail ( 安通越嶺古道 ), a continuation of the Qing dynasty Batongguan Trail connecting the Huadong Valley with the Pacific coast. Although rehabilitated as a bicycle service center after the bikeway opened, as of 2018 this station is once again abandoned. There’s really no need for a full-fledged rest station on this route anyhow—it isn’t a long bikeway, nor is any climbing required. View Image Details Bridge pylons somewhere south of Antong Station. I wasn’t able to puzzle out whether this former railway bridge collapsed in some disaster or if it was dismantled when the railway line was rerouted. View Image Details A former sentry post at the leading edge of the former Dongli Station platform. The characters read “safety first” ( 安全第一 ) and something along the lines of “check and double-check” ( 確認！再確認 ). View Image Details Whereas Antong Station was abandoned, Dongli Station is enjoying a second life as a community center. Soon I crossed into Fuli , the southernmost district of Hualien , and came to the end of the line, Dongli Railway Station (東里鐵馬驛站). Unlike the derelict station in Antong this one was open to the public and staffed with several friendly locals. The interior had the feeling of a community center as much as a rest stop—and noticing that they served coffee, I ordered one on ice and sat beneath a fan for awhile, planning my next move. Idle curiosity led me to the station front—and here I noticed several placards with information about local attractions, none of which I had noted in advance research. Intrigued, I soon set forth for a quick ride around the neighbouring settlement of Dàzhuāng (大庄, literally “Big Village”). View Image Details A former railway station successfully converted into a cycling rest stop. Several placards can be seen to the left of the door; these introduce several of the nearby village’s attractions. Dazhuang might not look like much to an unprepared outsider but it has quite a fascinating history. Situated in a contact zone between the traditional territories of Amis and Bunun peoples, it was settled by several waves of Plains Indigenous peoples (平埔族群) escaping the encroachment of Han Chinese settlers on their lands in southwestern Taiwan. Beginning in the late 1820s many groups of Taivoan (大武壠族), Makatao (馬卡道族), and Siraya (西拉雅族) people made the long overland journey to this far frontier, which was not directly administered by the Qing until the establishment of Taitung Prefecture in 1887 11 . After the Japanese conquest of Taiwan many Hakka migrated here from other parts of the island, initially on their own, and later with the encouragement of the colonial government 12 . Nowadays the settlement remains mixed, with the largest population of Plains Indigenous people in eastern Taiwan living alongside Hakka and Han Taiwanese. View Image Details A Plains Indigenous shrine in Dongli. View Image Details Inside the public shrine in Dongli. Dazhuang Public Shrine (大庄公廨) is the only Plains Indigenous shrine in eastern Taiwan. These shrines are generally known as kuba , although many variations exist in different languages and dialects spoken by the Plains Indigenous peoples 13 , as with all other terms in this section. Kuba serve as halls of worship as well as community meeting spaces, and they are the sites of important ceremonies and rituals. This particular shrine venerates an ancestral spirit known in Mandarin Chinese as Ālìzǔ ( 阿立祖 ), embodied by the liquid contained within ritual vessels resting on the ground inside the shrine. The interior features a central column with a bamboo fishing trap where the spirits rest 14 . As with other Plains Indigenous shrines in Taiwan, this one also displays the influence of Han Taiwanese religious customs; note the divination blocks (筊杯) resting on the low stone altar and the incense burner in front of it. The intermixing of Taiwanese folk religious and Plains Indigenous customs is a consequence of the long decades of colonial suppression (both Japanese and KMT), during which Indigenous spiritual practices went underground, often by integrating with accepted customs.

Although it isn’t explicitly stated in any text I’ve consulted, the pharmacy was probably the exclusive liquor and tobacco dealer in the area, which would have certainly helped fund the construction of such an ornate house. Unfortunately the structure was severely damaged in the 1951 East Rift Valley earthquakes and Typhoon Bilis (碧利斯颱風) in 2000.

Just as Yonghe is famous for soy milk, Chishang is the place most strongly associated with bento boxes (biàndang 便當) in the Taiwanese imagination 19 , so that’s exactly what I ordered.

Without being able to see much on the increasingly dark country roads I have little to report from this segment of the journey. Eventually I arrived in town to find lodging for the night and attend to necessities like a shower and a proper dinner. With options limited as evening wore on I opted to sample the eponymous Guanshan Bento Box (關山便當), mostly to see how it compared to the one I had earlier. This bento was far more satisfying, and I went to sleep feeling very positive about the day’s ride. In the next entry I will document the remainder of the trip to Taitung City . I’m fond of sampling famous local breakfast fare when I’m on these road trips. On this particular day I swung by the Xīnxīng Street Sesame Flatbread Shop (新興街燒餅店) and had a breakfast sandwich with eggs, vegetables, and sprouts (a rather unusual ingredient by Taiwanese standards). ↩ The earliest name for this theater was Chitose (千歲座 or 千歲館 in Japanese). It seems plausible that its name was changed after it was rebuilt—although that might also have taken place after the arrival of the KMT in 1945. ↩ Dealing with the KMT’s ill-gotten movie theaters was an election issue leading up to 2004. More information about the KMT seizure of movie theaters can be found here ↩ Except where otherwise mentioned, theater capacities on this blog are sourced from the Taiwan General Guide (台灣通覽), published by Ta-Hwa Evening News (大華晚報社) in 1960. ↩ Business records have been a useful means of locating old theaters around Taiwan. Here is the entry for Yudu Theater. ↩ Posko was transliterated into Hokkien as Phok-sik-koh (Púshígé 璞石閣), which alludes to the marble outcrops along the Xiùgūluán River ( 秀姑巒溪 ) that have the appearance of unpolished jade. ↩ The construction of the Batongguan Trail was an enormous undertaking directed by Qing military commander Wu Kuang-liang ( 吳光亮 ), who was tasked with implementing the “open the mountains and pacify the savages” (開山撫番) policy. The Japanese later expanded and rerouted the trail, which became the Batongguan Traversing Trail (八通關越嶺古道). ↩ One important Japanese colonial site I neglected to photograph on this trip is the Yuli Police Station (玉里警察官吏派出所, originally 璞石閣警察官吏派出所), which traces its history back to 1899. I doubt much of the current structure is quite that old—it has been renovated several times over the years—but it was certainly among the first police stations established in the Huadong Valley. ↩ This demographic shift is described over and over again in my writing about the Huadong Valley so I won’t repeat the entire story here; just read some of my other posts in this series and you’ll find out much more about it. ↩ For reference, the former Shinto shrine in Halawan is known by many names: 哈拉灣神社, 樂合神社, 下撈灣祠, and 洛和社. Read more about it (in Chinese, of course) here , here , and here . ↩ The imposition of foreign rule led to open rebellion in 1888, a historic event known as the Dazhuang Incident ( 大庄事件 ), in which an alliance of Plains Indigenous, Amis, Puyuma, and Hakka fought battles all up and down the Huadong Valley, only to be defeated after Qing reinforcements arrived. For more information about the current status of the Plains Indigenous peoples mentioned here try these English language articles about the Taivoan , Makatao , and Siraya . ↩ The Hakka migration from 1906 to around 1930 is sometimes referred to as the “second migration” (二次移民). The Japanese colonial authorities were intent on developing eastern Taiwan for agriculture and went to some lengths to attract Hakka farmers ( e.g. by providing five years of free rent), who they felt would be more industrious and productive than in the Indigenous people already living there. A census taken in 1932 by the Japanese colonial authorities recorded a mixed population of approximately 1,600 residents in Dazhuang: 780 Taiwanese Indigenous people, 500 Hakka, and 240 Fujianese, among others. This population data is featured on the Chinese language Wikipedia entry for Dazhuang and derives from a book by the title of 大庄平埔西拉雅族文物圖說與民俗植物圖誌 by 張振岳. I’m guessing this information ultimately derives from the 1930 Taiwan Census . Note: Japanese statistics typically identify Hakka as Cantonese people , for many Hakka settlers in Taiwan trace their ancestry to northeastern Guangdong . ↩ “Public Shrine” is the English translation on the placards by the front of Dongli Station. The Chinese characters (公廨; gōngxiè in Mandarin Chinese) are borrowed from a Japanese transliteration (kōkai) of what is likely a Makatao word (konkai). Taivoan people typically call these shrines kuba (or some variation thereof; kuma , kuva , and kuwa also appear in the literature). Whichever way it is spoken, it doesn’t exactly translate to “public shrine”; the meaning is perhaps closer to “clubhouse”, which is reflected in another common Chinese word for these cultural institutions, huìsuǒ (會所). ↩ This bamboo fishing trap is known as the kogitanta agisen in the Taivoan language (Xiàng Shénzuò 向神座 in Mandarin Chinese, literally “seat of the Xiang Dieties”) according to the Wikipedia entry for Taivoan people . Additional information about the rites and customs of the Plains Indigeneous people of Dazhuang can be found in Chinese here and here . ↩ For more about the history of the Liutui Hakka check out this post about a bicycle trip through the area. ↩ More information about this old house can be found in the Chinese language blogosphere; for this post I consulted sources here , here , and here . ↩ This same tobacco barn is featured at the bottom of this post cataloging some of the tobacco barns of Ruisui. I write more about the history of tobacco cultivation in the Huadong Valley in a previous entry in this series . ↩ No trace remains of the other theaters in town. Fuli Theater (富里戲院), with a capacity of 650, was located somewhere Zhongshan Road. I’ve also learned of the existence of Dongli Theater (東里戲院), with a capacity of 500, but have no idea where it might be located. More information about the history of cinema in Fuli Township can be read (in Chinese) here . ↩ Read more about Taiwanese bento box culture here and here . ↩ Chishang reputedly had three movie theaters in its heyday. Apart from the aforementioned Wuzhou Theater, which is still standing, Chishang was also home to Yùshān Theater (玉山戲院), rebuilt after a fire with a capacity of 1,000, and Guāngmíng Theater (光明戲院). I’ve not found any trace of either of these—apart from the posters in the lunchbox museum anyway. ↩

Day four of riding through the Huadong Valley of eastern Taiwan in 2018 began in Yuli , the midpoint of this bicycle trip from Hualien City to Taitung City . From the weather report I knew I’d have another challenging ride ahead—yet again the mercury was due to exceed 35 degrees. Luckily I was in no great rush, as I had allocated an entire week for a trip that experienced riders could easily manage in two days. I made good use of that extra time, making numerous stops and detours to document some of the many historic and cultural sites along the way, many of them quite obscure. I ended the day in Guanshan , slightly more than 40 kilometers down the valley. View Image Details The view across the central roundabout in Yuli. The oldest cinema in town was once located on the block visible in this photo. My first order of business after a healthy breakfast 1 was to conduct a survey of Yuli’s historic cinemas. The earliest theater in Yuli was likely a multi-purpose performance venue built primarily with wood 2 . Located on the central roundabout, it was eventually replaced with a reinforced concrete structure with seating for 700 patrons, probably in the early 1940s. After the arrival of the Kuomintang (KMT) it was among 19 theaters designated for nationalization—but there appears to be some disagreement about whether it was actually seized along with the others in 1947. It is generally remembered as Tiānshēng Theater (天聲戲院) but was listed as Xīnguāng Theater (新光戲院) in KMT party records 3 . It was demolished long ago. View Image Details This supermarket occupies the site of the former Yushan Theater. A little further east one will find the former site of Yùshān Theater (玉山戲院), likely founded in the 1950s. With a capacity of 865 4 , it was slightly larger than the competition. After it closed sometime in the 1980s or 1990s it was supposedly turned into an arcade. As with the former Ruisui Theater, featured in the previous update , it has now been replaced by an outpost of the Tǒngguān Supermarket (統冠聯合超市, generally written as Tkmart), a chain popular across eastern Taiwan. Whether any part of the original structure remains is unclear. View Image Details The former Yudu Theater under renovation. Only a small part of the vibrant yellow facade remains visible. I was eager to explore the remains of Yùdū Theater (玉都戲院) after finding it in a search of the relevant business records 5 prior to embarking on this road trip, so I was quite disappointed to arrive and find it already undergoing renovations. Founded in 1968 near the front of the train station, it was the largest and most luxurious theater in town when it was built. Only a small part of its distinctive yellow facade could still be seen. From what I know it is now an outpost of the increasingly ubiquitous Poya (寶雅) chain of cosmetic stores. View Image Details A view of the derelict Xinxing Theater from the street. It is located in a residential neighbourhood far removed from the downtown core of Yuli. An old man noticed my interest in Yudu Theater and provided some useful tips about the locations of another theater in town. It was on my list but I hadn’t been able to uncover any details nor locate it on satellite maps—and as soon as I learned where it was, it all made sense. Movie theaters are typically situated near the busiest parts of the commercial centers of small towns like Yuli but Xīnxīng Theater (新興戲院 or 新星戲院) was built in a residential area on the north side of town, far from the action. As with the others it closed sometime in the 1990s, after which it was converted into an auto mechanic shop. It is now abandoned and I did not find any obvious means of entry. View Image Details A former theater converted into an auto mechanic and finally abandoned to to fate. A brief introduction to Yuli, for context: as the largest settlement in the central Huadong Valley it has long been a regional transportation hub. Prior to the arrival of Chinese settlers in the late 19th century the area was inhabited by several Taiwanese Indigenous groups: the Amis people , who called it Posko 6 ; the mountain-dwelling Bunun ; and a variety of Plains Indigenous people who emigrated from western Taiwan beginning in the 19th century (a story elucidated later in this post). The opening of the 152 kilometer-long Bātōngguān Trail (八通關古道) in 1875 7 greatly increased the inflow of Han Chinese settlers, and this trend continued after the arrival of the Japanese, who renamed it Tamazato (literally “Jade Village”, which is where the name Yuli comes from in Mandarin Chinese) in 1920. View Image Details On the visiting path at the former Yuli Shinto Shrine . View Image Details The former Yuli Credit Union, a 1930s reinforced concrete structure with pebble-washed details, now derelict behind a somewhat more modern office of the local farmers’ association. It was designated a heritage property in 2006. Yuli thrived as an administrative center and important market town throughout the Japanese colonial era but few relics remain from those days 8 . Apart from the newly-restored Yuli Shinto Shrine (玉里神社), the subject of a full post on this blog , another example worth mentioning is the reinforced concrete Yuli Credit Union ( 玉里信用組合 ). Completed in 1930, it is located behind the more modern office of the local farmers’ association on the north side of town. It was designated a heritage property in 2006 but it doesn’t seem as if any effort has been made to restore it. View Image Details ROC nationalism on display in north-central Yuli. Many KMT veterans settled here in the 1960s and 1970s and plenty remained after retirement. Eastern Taiwan underwent a population explosion in the 1960s, a consequence of the opening of the Central Cross-Island Highway (中部橫貫公路) and the introduction of numerous government-sponsored development projects employing huge numbers of KMT veterans 9 . Boom turned to bust in the late 1980s as rising wages and policy changes restricting mining and forestry reduced employment opportunities in the valley. At its peak Yuli was probably home to around 50,000 residents, but nowadays fewer than 25,000 remain. Yuli is not alone in experiencing population outflow—the entire valley is hollowing out as people relocate to the bigger cities on the other side of the Central Mountain Range . View Image Details An old bomb shelter located south of the railway station. It isn’t obvious what era this is from, but I’d guess it’s from the 1950s. View Image Details Embarking on the Yuli-Fuli bikeway. This is a former railway bridge converted for the use of cyclists after the main line was rerouted to the west side of the river. View Image Details Plate boundary marker on the bikeway bridge. This is looking north along the valley; the Central Mountain Range is on the left and the Coastal Mountain Range is on the right. I headed south out of town to link up with the scenic Yuli-Fuli Bike Trail ( 玉富自行車道 ). This bikeway follows the former railway line, which jogged eastward across the continental divide. That line was planned in the 1920s, decades prior to the acceptance of plate tectonics theory , so we can excuse the builders for not realizing how much trouble they’d be causing future generations. The convergence rate between the Philippine Sea Plate (to the east) and the Yangtze Plate (part of the larger Eurasian Plate to the west) is 2 or 3 centimeters per year, high enough that the railway authority ended up having to invest considerable time and energy in maintaining the bridges that cross the divide. As such, the entire line was rerouted to the western side of the valley beginning in 1989—and after many years of neglect the former line was converted into the bikeway seen here.

The torii in a previous photo is visible at the bottom left. On the eastern side of the valley I made a small detour into Hālāwān (哈拉灣; Harawan or Harwan in the local tongue), a village nestled into the foothills of the coastal mountains. Halawan is home to a mixed settlement of Amis and the descendants of Plains Indigenous people from southwestern Taiwan. It was also home to a modest Shinto shrine during the Japanese colonial era, but not much remains of this apart from a couple of stone lanterns and a torii renovated in a vaguely indigenous style 10 . View Image Details Antong Station briefly served as a rest station for cyclists but was abandoned by the time I visited in 2018. View Image Details The former platform at Antong Station. The bikeway occupies the former railway bed. Back on the bikeway I breezed by Āntōng Station ( 安通車站 ), originally established in 1924. Antong has long been famous for its hot springs—there’s even an original Japanese onsen in the hills beyond the station. This was also the western terminus of the Antong Traversing Trail ( 安通越嶺古道 ), a continuation of the Qing dynasty Batongguan Trail connecting the Huadong Valley with the Pacific coast. Although rehabilitated as a bicycle service center after the bikeway opened, as of 2018 this station is once again abandoned. There’s really no need for a full-fledged rest station on this route anyhow—it isn’t a long bikeway, nor is any climbing required. View Image Details Bridge pylons somewhere south of Antong Station. I wasn’t able to puzzle out whether this former railway bridge collapsed in some disaster or if it was dismantled when the railway line was rerouted. View Image Details A former sentry post at the leading edge of the former Dongli Station platform. The characters read “safety first” ( 安全第一 ) and something along the lines of “check and double-check” ( 確認！再確認 ). View Image Details Whereas Antong Station was abandoned, Dongli Station is enjoying a second life as a community center. Soon I crossed into Fuli , the southernmost district of Hualien , and came to the end of the line, Dongli Railway Station (東里鐵馬驛站). Unlike the derelict station in Antong this one was open to the public and staffed with several friendly locals. The interior had the feeling of a community center as much as a rest stop—and noticing that they served coffee, I ordered one on ice and sat beneath a fan for awhile, planning my next move. Idle curiosity led me to the station front—and here I noticed several placards with information about local attractions, none of which I had noted in advance research. Intrigued, I soon set forth for a quick ride around the neighbouring settlement of Dàzhuāng (大庄, literally “Big Village”). View Image Details A former railway station successfully converted into a cycling rest stop. Several placards can be seen to the left of the door; these introduce several of the nearby village’s attractions. Dazhuang might not look like much to an unprepared outsider but it has quite a fascinating history. Situated in a contact zone between the traditional territories of Amis and Bunun peoples, it was settled by several waves of Plains Indigenous peoples (平埔族群) escaping the encroachment of Han Chinese settlers on their lands in southwestern Taiwan. Beginning in the late 1820s many groups of Taivoan (大武壠族), Makatao (馬卡道族), and Siraya (西拉雅族) people made the long overland journey to this far frontier, which was not directly administered by the Qing until the establishment of Taitung Prefecture in 1887 11 .

More information about the KMT seizure of movie theaters can be found here ↩ Except where otherwise mentioned, theater capacities on this blog are sourced from the Taiwan General Guide (台灣通覽), published by Ta-Hwa Evening News (大華晚報社) in 1960. ↩ Business records have been a useful means of locating old theaters around Taiwan. Here is the entry for Yudu Theater. ↩ Posko was transliterated into Hokkien as Phok-sik-koh (Púshígé 璞石閣), which alludes to the marble outcrops along the Xiùgūluán River ( 秀姑巒溪 ) that have the appearance of unpolished jade. ↩ The construction of the Batongguan Trail was an enormous undertaking directed by Qing military commander Wu Kuang-liang ( 吳光亮 ), who was tasked with implementing the “open the mountains and pacify the savages” (開山撫番) policy. The Japanese later expanded and rerouted the trail, which became the Batongguan Traversing Trail (八通關越嶺古道). ↩ One important Japanese colonial site I neglected to photograph on this trip is the Yuli Police Station (玉里警察官吏派出所, originally 璞石閣警察官吏派出所), which traces its history back to 1899. I doubt much of the current structure is quite that old—it has been renovated several times over the years—but it was certainly among the first police stations established in the Huadong Valley. ↩ This demographic shift is described over and over again in my writing about the Huadong Valley so I won’t repeat the entire story here; just read some of my other posts in this series and you’ll find out much more about it. ↩ For reference, the former Shinto shrine in Halawan is known by many names: 哈拉灣神社, 樂合神社, 下撈灣祠, and 洛和社. Read more about it (in Chinese, of course) here , here , and here . ↩ The imposition of foreign rule led to open rebellion in 1888, a historic event known as the Dazhuang Incident ( 大庄事件 ), in which an alliance of Plains Indigenous, Amis, Puyuma, and Hakka fought battles all up and down the Huadong Valley, only to be defeated after Qing reinforcements arrived. For more information about the current status of the Plains Indigenous peoples mentioned here try these English language articles about the Taivoan , Makatao , and Siraya . ↩ The Hakka migration from 1906 to around 1930 is sometimes referred to as the “second migration” (二次移民). The Japanese colonial authorities were intent on developing eastern Taiwan for agriculture and went to some lengths to attract Hakka farmers ( e.g. by providing five years of free rent), who they felt would be more industrious and productive than in the Indigenous people already living there. A census taken in 1932 by the Japanese colonial authorities recorded a mixed population of approximately 1,600 residents in Dazhuang: 780 Taiwanese Indigenous people, 500 Hakka, and 240 Fujianese, among others. This population data is featured on the Chinese language Wikipedia entry for Dazhuang and derives from a book by the title of 大庄平埔西拉雅族文物圖說與民俗植物圖誌 by 張振岳. I’m guessing this information ultimately derives from the 1930 Taiwan Census . Note: Japanese statistics typically identify Hakka as Cantonese people , for many Hakka settlers in Taiwan trace their ancestry to northeastern Guangdong . ↩ “Public Shrine” is the English translation on the placards by the front of Dongli Station. The Chinese characters (公廨; gōngxiè in Mandarin Chinese) are borrowed from a Japanese transliteration (kōkai) of what is likely a Makatao word (konkai). Taivoan people typically call these shrines kuba (or some variation thereof; kuma , kuva , and kuwa also appear in the literature). Whichever way it is spoken, it doesn’t exactly translate to “public shrine”; the meaning is perhaps closer to “clubhouse”, which is reflected in another common Chinese word for these cultural institutions, huìsuǒ (會所). ↩ This bamboo fishing trap is known as the kogitanta agisen in the Taivoan language (Xiàng Shénzuò 向神座 in Mandarin Chinese, literally “seat of the Xiang Dieties”) according to the Wikipedia entry for Taivoan people . Additional information about the rites and customs of the Plains Indigeneous people of Dazhuang can be found in Chinese here and here . ↩ For more about the history of the Liutui Hakka check out this post about a bicycle trip through the area. ↩ More information about this old house can be found in the Chinese language blogosphere; for this post I consulted sources here , here , and here . ↩ This same tobacco barn is featured at the bottom of this post cataloging some of the tobacco barns of Ruisui. I write more about the history of tobacco cultivation in the Huadong Valley in a previous entry in this series . ↩ No trace remains of the other theaters in town. Fuli Theater (富里戲院), with a capacity of 650, was located somewhere Zhongshan Road. I’ve also learned of the existence of Dongli Theater (東里戲院), with a capacity of 500, but have no idea where it might be located. More information about the history of cinema in Fuli Township can be read (in Chinese) here . ↩ Read more about Taiwanese bento box culture here and here . ↩ Chishang reputedly had three movie theaters in its heyday. Apart from the aforementioned Wuzhou Theater, which is still standing, Chishang was also home to Yùshān Theater (玉山戲院), rebuilt after a fire with a capacity of 1,000, and Guāngmíng Theater (光明戲院). I’ve not found any trace of either of these—apart from the posters in the lunchbox museum anyway. ↩

Shigang Dam 石岡水壩 is a barrage dam on the lower reaches of the Dàjiǎ River 大甲溪 in Shigang , Taichung , Taiwan . It was constructed between 1974 and 1977, not long after the completion of the Techi Dam 德基水壩 , a far more ambitious hydroelectric project further upstream. Intended mainly for flood control and irrigation purposes, it was heavily damaged in the devastating 921 Earthquake of 1999 and later repaired.

Yuli Shinto Shrine 玉里神社 is a Japanese colonial era historic site in Yuli , the largest town in the middle of the Huādōng Valley 花東縱谷 of eastern Taiwan . Formally known as Yuli Shrine 玉里社 ( Tamasato-sha in the original Japanese), it was constructed in 1928, the third year of the Shōwa era . The vast majority of Taiwan’s several hundred Shinto shrines were destroyed in the decades following the Japanese withdrawal—but enough of this shrine remained to justify its official designation as a cultural asset in 2008. Since then some effort has been undertaken to restore the site, which occupies a hilltop at the western edge of town, and it now ranks among the most well-preserved in the remote eastern part of the country. View Image Details The entrance to the former shrine is obscured by ramshackle residences. The former shrine is situated down a short laneway, obscured by ramshackle residences likely built by KMT veterans in the 1960s. Here one will find a grey pebble-washed torii 鳥居 , a traditional Japanese gate, marking the entrance to the former shrine 1 . Ascend the stairs to follow the sandō 参道 (visiting path), which is lined by more than a dozen original stone lanterns with inscriptions made illegible when they were filled with cement.

The visiting path continues along the hilltop to the shattered remnants of the haiden 拜殿 , or hall of worship, where supplicants would have conducted ceremonies and engaged in prayer. From what I’ve read it was common for Japanese police officers to visit the shrine before or after taking the treacherous Bātōngguān Trail 八通關越嶺古道 across the Central Mountain Range , and it was also frequented by soldiers prior to embarking for the front lines during World War 2. In archival photos this hall has a curved rooftop held aloft by several reinforced concrete posts much like those of the torii .

Although the site features numerous plaques introducing various aspects of the shrine little is said about when or why it was destroyed. This is a common pattern in Taiwan, where popular narratives often gloss over the less flattering aspects of history. The prosaic truth is that many Shinto shrines were dismantled after Japan switched recognition to the PRC in 1972. The ROC government responded by promulgating an edict in 1974 requiring the destruction of whatever Imperial Japanese relics remained in Taiwan, a subject discussed at length in this article about the Suhua Highway . These orders were carried out by local officials with varying degrees of diligence and enthusiasm, which is why some trace of the shrine at Yuli survives to the present day.

Beigou Forbidden City 北溝故宮 is an obscure historic site hidden in the hills of Wufeng , Taichung . From 1949 to 1965 it was the provisional base of operations for the team of archivists, curators, scholars, and technicians overseeing the subset of the Palace Museum collection sent for safekeeping to Taiwan by the Kuomintang (KMT) in the later stages of the Chinese Civil War . Nowadays this collection is managed and displayed by the National Palace Museum 國立故宮博物院 (or simply Gùgōng 故宮 for short), situated in Taipei , and almost nothing remains of the facilities in Wufeng. The one exception is an underground vault constructed in 1953. View Image Details The recently excavated entrance to a historic vault in Taichung. Both the National Palace Museum in Taiwan and the Palace Museum in China trace their histories back to the Forbidden City in Beijing. Established in 1925, the Palace Museum collection originates with the vast imperial holdings of the Ming and Qing dynasty emperors who resided there. In 1933, under threat of invasion by Japanese forces, the huge collection was boxed and sent overland to Nanjing, the first of several stops on a decades-long mission to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands 1 . View Image Details Approaching an earthquake-damaged vault dug into a Taichung hillside. Following the Japanese surrender and the resumption of hostilities between the KMT and communist forces the collection was split in two, and many of the most valuable pieces were transported by sea to Keelung , at the northern tip of Taiwan, in 1949. From there the collection was sent by rail to a warehouse in Yangmei , Taoyuan , and then to the former sugar factory in Taichung, before it was finally secreted away to purpose-built facilities in Wufeng by 1950. The collection remained there until the opening of the National Palace Museum in Taipei in 1965. View Image Details Inside the U-shaped vault at a former storage site for the National Palace Museum collection. The grounds of the former museum facility lay idle for many years after the collection was relocated. Eventually the site was repurposed for use by the Taiwan Provincial Film Studio 台灣省電影製片廠 and Taiwan Provincial Symphony Orchestra 省立台灣交響樂團. In 1990 the site was again transformed, this time into a theme park, Taiwan Studio City 台灣電影文化城 2 , but it closed in 1999 after suffering heavy damage in the 921 Earthquake . After clearing the debris nothing remained at the surface to indicate that this site had been home to the palace museum collection for 15 years. View Image Details Around the bend of the U-shaped vault. Earthquake damage is more obvious here. The vault seen in these photographs was approved in 1952, constructed in 1953, and in active use from 1954 until the entire site was abolished in 1965. It was built to withstand disasters both natural and manmade (mainly in the form of air raids) and seems to have held up fairly well through decades of neglect, all things considered. It was heavily damaged in the earthquake and buried under a landslide. From what I’ve read, nobody knew exactly where it was located until it was excavated in 2013. It is an interesting coincidence that it spent around the same amount of time hosting some of the world’s greatest art as it did completely cut-off from the outside world. View Image Details Built to withstand natural disasters and military airstrikes alike. View Image Details View Image Details View Image Details Just inside the far end of the U-shaped National Palace Museum vault. Renewed interest in the site and its cultural value 3 prompted the Taichung government to register the damaged vault as a historic monument in 2014. Officially known as the Beigou Forbidden City Vault 北溝故宮文物典藏山洞 (and sometimes more informally as the Wufeng Beigou Tunnel 霧峰北溝坑道), the site was almost completely neglected apart from the installation of a historical plaque near the entrance of the vault. From what I understand, part of the delay in developing the site is fragmented property rights; the underlying land is divided amongst more than a dozen shareholders, all of whom would have to agree to whatever redevelopment plan the city government dreams up. In 2019 one landowner filled the pits granting access to the vault, ostensibly because of the hazard they posed 4 . View Image Details The second entrance is not nearly as accessible as the first. Prior to the closure of the site I managed to slip inside to take a look around. Nothing remains inside the vault, of course, and while there is visible deformation from the earthquake in many areas, it remains structurally intact. It is somewhat hard to imagine this obscure hole in the ground filled with parts of China’s national treasure, but that is indeed the purpose it once served. Hopefully the Taichung government can get its act together and reach a deal with the landowners to redevelop the site and bring this story to life. In the meantime, if you happen to be in Taiwan and wish to visit the site, you should be aware that access may be difficult and there’s no guarantee you’ll find much of anything to look at these days, but if things change I’ll be sure to update this post! Sixth Tone has a good series documenting the wartime travels of the palace museum collection; read it here: part 1 , part 2 , and part 3 . For a more detailed history of the movements of the collection this page from the National Palace Museum (in Chinese) is highly informative. You might also like to peruse this history told from a more Chinese perspective for comparison. ↩ Parts of the former theme park were still visible in 2012 according to this blog but I saw no trace of it while visiting in 2017. Taiwan Studio City was one of several theme parks dedicated to Taiwanese cinema. Apart from film studios in Shilin and Beitou, there was also the Baihe Taiwan Film & TV Town 白河台灣電影文化城 , which is now closed and abandoned. ↩ Two Chinese language news reports about the excavation can be found here and here . This site also features a series of interviews with elders in the surrounding community, many of whom worked at the original museum facility. ↩ A news report detailing the second entombment of the vault can be seen here . ↩

Officially known as the Beigou Forbidden City Vault 北溝故宮文物典藏山洞 (and sometimes more informally as the Wufeng Beigou Tunnel 霧峰北溝坑道), the site was almost completely neglected apart from the installation of a historical plaque near the entrance of the vault. From what I understand, part of the delay in developing the site is fragmented property rights; the underlying land is divided amongst more than a dozen shareholders, all of whom would have to agree to whatever redevelopment plan the city government dreams up. In 2019 one landowner filled the pits granting access to the vault, ostensibly because of the hazard they posed 4 . View Image Details The second entrance is not nearly as accessible as the first. Prior to the closure of the site I managed to slip inside to take a look around. Nothing remains inside the vault, of course, and while there is visible deformation from the earthquake in many areas, it remains structurally intact. It is somewhat hard to imagine this obscure hole in the ground filled with parts of China’s national treasure, but that is indeed the purpose it once served. Hopefully the Taichung government can get its act together and reach a deal with the landowners to redevelop the site and bring this story to life. In the meantime, if you happen to be in Taiwan and wish to visit the site, you should be aware that access may be difficult and there’s no guarantee you’ll find much of anything to look at these days, but if things change I’ll be sure to update this post! Sixth Tone has a good series documenting the wartime travels of the palace museum collection; read it here: part 1 , part 2 , and part 3 . For a more detailed history of the movements of the collection this page from the National Palace Museum (in Chinese) is highly informative. You might also like to peruse this history told from a more Chinese perspective for comparison. ↩ Parts of the former theme park were still visible in 2012 according to this blog but I saw no trace of it while visiting in 2017. Taiwan Studio City was one of several theme parks dedicated to Taiwanese cinema. Apart from film studios in Shilin and Beitou, there was also the Baihe Taiwan Film & TV Town 白河台灣電影文化城 , which is now closed and abandoned. ↩ Two Chinese language news reports about the excavation can be found here and here . This site also features a series of interviews with elders in the surrounding community, many of whom worked at the original museum facility. ↩ A news report detailing the second entombment of the vault can be seen here . ↩

Yuanlin is a modest settlement of approximately 125,000 residents located on the Changhua Plain (彰化平原) in eastern Changhua , Taiwan . It was formerly the most populous urban township in the nation, but Yuanlin was upgraded to a county-controlled city in 2015, second only to the administrative capital, Changhua City . Considerable work has been done in recent years to improve the urban environment of Yuanlin, and it feels like one of the few places between Taichung and Tainan that isn’t falling into disrepair and emptying out. That being said, urban decay remains widespread in Yuanlin, and there are many interesting ruins worth exploring before they disappear. For students of city planning and development this compact city also has quite a lot to offer—and in this post I aim to introduce some of its more intriguing features, mainly drawing upon photographs from 2013 to 2015, when I was spending significant amounts of time in the area. View Image Details Outside the Yuanlin First Market at dusk. The old market is obscured inside a more modern shell. Let’s begin with a brief history of Yuanlin. Although the area has been inhabited by Taiwanese Indigenous people for millennia, Yuanlin enters recorded history with the establishment of Changhua County in the early 18th century 1 . Yuanlin literally means “round forest”, but there are competing theories about the exact origins of the name; it may have referred to an area of woodland cleared around the burgeoning market town shortly after it was founded, or perhaps it was an allusion to a type of circular, fortified dwelling constructed by the earliest Chinese settlers 2 . The development of the city accelerated under Japanese rule, and Yuanlin emerged as a regional financial center and transportation hub in the early 20th century. During the post-war economic boom it became known across Taiwan for its preserved fruit industry, light manufacturing, and, more recently, a surprising concentration of wealthy residents 3 . View Image Details A glimpse of the original entrance to the colonial red brick market in Yuanlin. Lighting is poor beneath the sheet metal shell. View Image Details Herbal tea wholesaler inside Yuanlin First Market. Now let’s survey some of the many historic sites in town, starting with Yuanlin First Market ( 員林第一市場 ), one of the few remaining colonial red brick marketplaces in Taiwan 4 . It was constructed in 1935 and remains open to the public, though most vendors have migrated to the more modern structures surrounding the dilapidated colonial market. The former entrance is hidden from the street, and somewhat difficult to capture on film due to poor lighting beneath the sheet metal roofing. Many shutters look like they haven’t come up in decades and there is a stench of decay in the air. Still, it’s a fascinating structure to explore, and it’s almost criminal that the Changhua government has yet to designate it a heritage property worthy of preservation. View Image Details The former Yuanlin Transportation Co., Ltd., now a claw machine parlour immediately across from the central railway station. View Image Details This row of shophouses on Zhongshan Road is one of several former hospitals in downtown Yuanlin. This unit on the very end was converted into a credit union at some point, and now it’s a snazzy pizza restaurant. There are several interesting old shophouses in the area around the train station. Perhaps the most obvious of these is the former Yuanlin Transportation Co., Ltd. (員林運輸股份有限公司) on Guāngfù Street ( 光復街 ), immediately in front of the train station. A few more can be found along Zhōngshān Road ( 中山路 ), including a row of shophouses that was originally a hospital. It was eventually sliced into individual units, one of which was transformed into a credit union, and finally a pizzeria. View Image Details The magnificent Golden Empire Building. One of the most striking features of the urban environment of Yuanlin can be seen immediately in front of the railway station. Look straight ahead from the main exit and you can’t miss the ruins of the Golden Empire Building (黃金帝國大樓), an immense 14-storey entertainment complex built in the late 1980s and completed around 1991 5 . In its heyday it was home to movie theaters, gaming parlours, cram schools, a dance hall, an ice skating rink, a swimming pool, an indoor playground, and the usual assortment of banquet restaurants and karaoke venues commonly found in similar buildings around the nation 6 . The building suffered extensive damage in the devastating 921 Earthquake of 1999, and many of its businesses closed shortly thereafter, precipitating a long period of decline and the abandonment of the higher levels. By 2015 there were only a few seedy shops on the ground floor, a motley collection of street food vendors ringing the property, and an underground parkade still in operation. The rest of the structure remains derelict, awaiting the reconciliation of the dozens or even hundreds of shareholders 7 . View Image Details At a level crossing in Yuanlin prior to the opening of the railway overpass. View Image Details Dismantling the old Yuanlin Station. Here a worker sprays water on an excavator to keep the dust down. View Image Details Public art by Yayoi Kusama in front of the new Yuanlin Station shortly after it opened to the public. I was a witness to many of the changes that reshaped the railway service in Yuanlin in recent years. Previously the Western Trunk Line (縱貫線) bisected the city at ground level, restricting the flow of crosstown traffic to tunnels, bridges, and level crossings, but a major railway elevation project was completed in 2014. The new Yuanlin Station ( 員林車站 ) soon opened, and the last remnants of the old station, dating back to the 1960s, were demolished. Several works of public art debuted at the new station, including a quirky piece by Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama , intriguingly titled I’m Walking Out the Door in My High Heels to Go See My Boyfriend . View Image Details An old wooden railway station in back alley Yuanlin. The sign reads “yield before the main road” (ràng qián yǒu gàndào 讓前有幹道 ). View Image Details The former sugar railway line is now a bike trail and park. Other traces of railway history can be found not far from the central station. Head south and west and you will find the crumbling ruin of South Yuanlin Station (南員林站), a modest wooden building dating back to 1933. This was the transfer point for the Yuanlin Line (員林線) of the narrow gauge Taiwan sugar railway system . Apart from conveying sugarcane and refined sugar to and from the factory in Xihu , approximately 10 kilometers due west, this line also provided limited passenger service until 1973. In 1996 it was completely shut down, and after a period of disuse the dual gauge railway was torn out to create an extensive bike path . I’m not entirely sure what the orange archways are meant to signify; is this perhaps a reference to the famous torii tunnel of Fushimi Inari Taisha in Japan? View Image Details An oblique look at the immense railway granary in Yuanlin. View Image Details Although it is entirely abandoned, this granary is now a heritage property. Head north along the main trunk line and you’ll reach the immense Yuanlin Railway Granary ( 員林鐵路穀倉 ; informally: 員林立庫), a seven-storey reinforced concrete grain silo completed in 1976. It was one of perhaps ten trackside granaries built during the Taiwan Miracle , a period of explosive economic growth, and is one of only two left 8 . While it was in operation it was capable of storing 10,500 metric tons of grain, and inventory was managed by computer control. The opening of the Port of Taichung (and its many warehouses) undercut the need for the silo, and after remaining idle for many years it was designated a heritage property in 2003. This is a bit of a surprise; the relevant cultural authorities are not always so quick to protect elements of Taiwan’s post-war industrial history, particularly not something so big and ugly! Apparently plans are afoot to transform it into a museum and a tourist attraction of some kind. View Image Details The colonial fruit inspection office. East of the old railway silo is the relatively nondescript but well-preserved Yuanlin Fruit Inspection Office, built in 1934. It was one of several quality assurance offices built in the vicinity of Yuanlin Station, and it attests to the importance of the town as a transshipment point for a variety of products in the colonial era. Today it continues to serve its original purpose as a branch of the Ministry of Economic Affairs 9 . View Image Details The Japanese colonial era Bao’an Hospital, hidden behind a row of shops in central Yuanlin. View Image Details The back of the former Bao’an Hospital in Yuanlin. When this was constructed in the 1930s it was the tallest building in town. Hidden behind the busy thoroughfares at the heart of downtown Yuanlin is the impressive Bǎo’ān Hospital ( 保安醫院 ), built in 1936 by Céng Chūnquán ( 曾春泉 ), a doctor educated at the Taiwan Governor-General’s Office Medical School ( 臺灣總督府醫學校 ; now the National Taiwan University School of Medicine 國立臺灣大學醫學院 ). Four storeys in height, it was the tallest building in town when it was finished, but it is no longer visible from the street. Modern shops have colonized what would have been an impressive front yard many decades ago, and the former entrance to the hospital has been completely enclosed; access is only possible from an alleyway around back. View Image Details The former residence of the mayor of Yuanlin dates back to the early Japanese colonial era. Zhāng Family Residence ( 張氏洋樓 ; also known in Japanese as the Yuanlin Mayor’s Mansion 員林街長官邸) is another historic building lost in a maze of alleyways not far from the bustling commercial streets of downtown Yuanlin. This was the first of many impressive buildings constructed by Zhāng Qīnghuá (張清華), who rose to prominence as a wealthy businessman, politician, and landowner around the turn of the century. It likely dates back to 1912, although there appears to be some uncertainty about the exact date of construction in the historic record. From the sounds of it, hardly anything happened in Yuanlin without his involvement in the latter half of the Japanese colonial era. Sadly, his most beautiful residence, Shǔyuán ( 曙園 ), was demolished in 2012. Inexplicably, it remains an empty lot across from a seedy KTV (pictured later in this article). View Image Details The main hall at Xingxian Academy, now located in Yuanlin Park. View Image Details The study halls on the right side of Xingxian Academy are still frequented by students. Xìngxián Academy ( 興賢書院 ) is a newly restored Qing dynasty era private school situated within Yuanlin Park ( 員林公園 ). It traces its history back to 1807, when a temple venerating Lord Wénchāng {文昌帝君), the god of examinations, was established at this location. This temple soon became a center of study for the surrounding area, particularly after members of the local gentry 10 raised funds to renovate the structure and formally convert it into an academy in the early 1880s. It continued to serve as a meeting place for intellectuals well into the new century despite the introduction of public schooling in the Japanese colonial period. After the war the property underlying Xingxian Academy was confiscated by the ROC government, part of extensive land reform projects, and the academy was effectively abandoned to fate. People in desperate need of housing moved in, and the structure soon became an unsightly slum 11 . Eventually the cultural value of the former academy became widely recognized, but before preservation efforts could get under way, it was almost completely destroyed in the 921 Earthquake. Following this disaster the remaining tenants were evicted (with compensation) and the academy was completely rebuilt from the ground up, opening to the public in the mid-2000s. These days it continues to provide study space in the wings—and Wenchang remains enshrined in the main hall. View Image Details Xuan Wu looms over the streets of Yuanlin at Hengwen Temple. I knew little of Taiwanese temple culture back when I was spending a lot of time in Yuanlin—so I could hardly believe my eyes when I rounded a corner and saw a giant god looming over the streets of south-central Yuanlin. This is Héngwén Temple (衡文宮), home of a 72 foot-tall statue of Xuán Wǔ ( 玄武 ), a Taoist warrior-god associated with the season of winter and the north. There is much to say about this temple so I encourage you to read my full post ; it is among the most interesting folk religious sites I have visited in Taiwan. View Image Details Traditional Taiwanese glove puppetry show on the outskirts of Yuanlin. Yuanlin is also one of the first places I saw bùdàixì ( 布袋戲 ), traditional glove puppetry often performed in Taiwanese Hokkien (not Mandarin Chinese). These shows are typically staged from the back of a blue delivery truck 12 , an iconic sight across rural Taiwan. Many puppet shows are one-man operations with recorded music, song, and dialogue piped over a rudimentary sound system, although I’ve seen a few old masters performing the speaking parts themselves. The performance takes place regardless of whether any mortals are looking on—ultimately this is entertainment for the gods and spirits residing in the nearest temple, some of which are known to be especially fond of puppet shows 13 .

That’s the derelict Yicheng Cannery. It is fairly common for even the most well-developed cities in Taiwan to contain traces of an agrarian past, and Yuanlin is no outlier. Jiāng Family Jìyáng Hall ( 江家濟陽堂 ) is a gorgeous old sanheyuan (traditional Taiwanese courtyard home) hidden in the alleyways immediately to the east of the only movie theater still operating in town, the Yuanlin Cineplex (員林影城). Its exact date of construction is unknown, but I’d estimate that it was probably built in the 1920s given the pebble-washed surfaces on the portico. While taking these photos an old woman who still lives here invited me in for tea, which was quite an interesting experience! I’m always intrigued to find historic homes like this one still embedded in the matrix of the modern city, and it was a special treat to step inside and enjoy some snacks and smalltalk as the sun slipped behind the surrounding buildings.

Here in Yuanlin the best-preserved example is now the Police Museum (警察故事館), which exhibits historic artifacts and information related to the National Police Agency of Taiwan. I can’t comment on whatever might be found inside; despite visiting this museum on several occasions I have never found it open.

Prior to that it was situated next to the railway granary, but the location was a little awkward to get to and there wasn’t much room for parking. Even so, it was always an interesting experience seeing trains rumble by meters from the booths at the back of the market.

In many ways Yuanlin was a proving ground for developing this approach, for it was among the first mid-sized cities in Taiwan where I spent a fair amount of time just hanging out (as opposed to passing through). Slowly but surely I became more aware of my surroundings and what distinguished them from other places—and after five years of ongoing study in pursuit of satisfying my curiosity, I am glad to finally share some of my findings from this modest city in central Taiwan. The Qing took a renewed interest in Taiwan following a 1721 rebellion led by duck farmer Zhū Yīguì (朱一貴).

Apparently some of the earliest settlers in the Yuanlin area were Hakka people from Raoping County in easternmost Guangdong .

Yuanlin is a modest settlement of approximately 125,000 residents located on the Changhua Plain (彰化平原) in eastern Changhua , Taiwan . It was formerly the most populous urban township in the nation, but Yuanlin was upgraded to a county-controlled city in 2015, second only to the administrative capital, Changhua City . Considerable work has been done in recent years to improve the urban environment of Yuanlin, and it feels like one of the few places between Taichung and Tainan that isn’t falling into disrepair and emptying out. That being said, urban decay remains widespread in Yuanlin, and there are many interesting ruins worth exploring before they disappear. For students of city planning and development this compact city also has quite a lot to offer—and in this post I aim to introduce some of its more intriguing features, mainly drawing upon photographs from 2013 to 2015, when I was spending significant amounts of time in the area. View Image Details Outside the Yuanlin First Market at dusk. The old market is obscured inside a more modern shell. Let’s begin with a brief history of Yuanlin. Although the area has been inhabited by Taiwanese Indigenous people for millennia, Yuanlin enters recorded history with the establishment of Changhua County in the early 18th century 1 . Yuanlin literally means “round forest”, but there are competing theories about the exact origins of the name; it may have referred to an area of woodland cleared around the burgeoning market town shortly after it was founded, or perhaps it was an allusion to a type of circular, fortified dwelling constructed by the earliest Chinese settlers 2 . The development of the city accelerated under Japanese rule, and Yuanlin emerged as a regional financial center and transportation hub in the early 20th century. During the post-war economic boom it became known across Taiwan for its preserved fruit industry, light manufacturing, and, more recently, a surprising concentration of wealthy residents 3 . View Image Details A glimpse of the original entrance to the colonial red brick market in Yuanlin. Lighting is poor beneath the sheet metal shell. View Image Details Herbal tea wholesaler inside Yuanlin First Market. Now let’s survey some of the many historic sites in town, starting with Yuanlin First Market ( 員林第一市場 ), one of the few remaining colonial red brick marketplaces in Taiwan 4 . It was constructed in 1935 and remains open to the public, though most vendors have migrated to the more modern structures surrounding the dilapidated colonial market. The former entrance is hidden from the street, and somewhat difficult to capture on film due to poor lighting beneath the sheet metal roofing. Many shutters look like they haven’t come up in decades and there is a stench of decay in the air. Still, it’s a fascinating structure to explore, and it’s almost criminal that the Changhua government has yet to designate it a heritage property worthy of preservation. View Image Details The former Yuanlin Transportation Co., Ltd., now a claw machine parlour immediately across from the central railway station. View Image Details This row of shophouses on Zhongshan Road is one of several former hospitals in downtown Yuanlin. This unit on the very end was converted into a credit union at some point, and now it’s a snazzy pizza restaurant. There are several interesting old shophouses in the area around the train station. Perhaps the most obvious of these is the former Yuanlin Transportation Co., Ltd. (員林運輸股份有限公司) on Guāngfù Street ( 光復街 ), immediately in front of the train station. A few more can be found along Zhōngshān Road ( 中山路 ), including a row of shophouses that was originally a hospital. It was eventually sliced into individual units, one of which was transformed into a credit union, and finally a pizzeria. View Image Details The magnificent Golden Empire Building. One of the most striking features of the urban environment of Yuanlin can be seen immediately in front of the railway station. Look straight ahead from the main exit and you can’t miss the ruins of the Golden Empire Building (黃金帝國大樓), an immense 14-storey entertainment complex built in the late 1980s and completed around 1991 5 . In its heyday it was home to movie theaters, gaming parlours, cram schools, a dance hall, an ice skating rink, a swimming pool, an indoor playground, and the usual assortment of banquet restaurants and karaoke venues commonly found in similar buildings around the nation 6 . The building suffered extensive damage in the devastating 921 Earthquake of 1999, and many of its businesses closed shortly thereafter, precipitating a long period of decline and the abandonment of the higher levels. By 2015 there were only a few seedy shops on the ground floor, a motley collection of street food vendors ringing the property, and an underground parkade still in operation. The rest of the structure remains derelict, awaiting the reconciliation of the dozens or even hundreds of shareholders 7 . View Image Details At a level crossing in Yuanlin prior to the opening of the railway overpass. View Image Details Dismantling the old Yuanlin Station. Here a worker sprays water on an excavator to keep the dust down. View Image Details Public art by Yayoi Kusama in front of the new Yuanlin Station shortly after it opened to the public. I was a witness to many of the changes that reshaped the railway service in Yuanlin in recent years. Previously the Western Trunk Line (縱貫線) bisected the city at ground level, restricting the flow of crosstown traffic to tunnels, bridges, and level crossings, but a major railway elevation project was completed in 2014. The new Yuanlin Station ( 員林車站 ) soon opened, and the last remnants of the old station, dating back to the 1960s, were demolished. Several works of public art debuted at the new station, including a quirky piece by Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama , intriguingly titled I’m Walking Out the Door in My High Heels to Go See My Boyfriend . View Image Details An old wooden railway station in back alley Yuanlin. The sign reads “yield before the main road” (ràng qián yǒu gàndào 讓前有幹道 ). View Image Details The former sugar railway line is now a bike trail and park. Other traces of railway history can be found not far from the central station. Head south and west and you will find the crumbling ruin of South Yuanlin Station (南員林站), a modest wooden building dating back to 1933. This was the transfer point for the Yuanlin Line (員林線) of the narrow gauge Taiwan sugar railway system . Apart from conveying sugarcane and refined sugar to and from the factory in Xihu , approximately 10 kilometers due west, this line also provided limited passenger service until 1973. In 1996 it was completely shut down, and after a period of disuse the dual gauge railway was torn out to create an extensive bike path . I’m not entirely sure what the orange archways are meant to signify; is this perhaps a reference to the famous torii tunnel of Fushimi Inari Taisha in Japan? View Image Details An oblique look at the immense railway granary in Yuanlin. View Image Details Although it is entirely abandoned, this granary is now a heritage property. Head north along the main trunk line and you’ll reach the immense Yuanlin Railway Granary ( 員林鐵路穀倉 ; informally: 員林立庫), a seven-storey reinforced concrete grain silo completed in 1976. It was one of perhaps ten trackside granaries built during the Taiwan Miracle , a period of explosive economic growth, and is one of only two left 8 . While it was in operation it was capable of storing 10,500 metric tons of grain, and inventory was managed by computer control. The opening of the Port of Taichung (and its many warehouses) undercut the need for the silo, and after remaining idle for many years it was designated a heritage property in 2003. This is a bit of a surprise; the relevant cultural authorities are not always so quick to protect elements of Taiwan’s post-war industrial history, particularly not something so big and ugly! Apparently plans are afoot to transform it into a museum and a tourist attraction of some kind. View Image Details The colonial fruit inspection office. East of the old railway silo is the relatively nondescript but well-preserved Yuanlin Fruit Inspection Office, built in 1934. It was one of several quality assurance offices built in the vicinity of Yuanlin Station, and it attests to the importance of the town as a transshipment point for a variety of products in the colonial era. Today it continues to serve its original purpose as a branch of the Ministry of Economic Affairs 9 . View Image Details The Japanese colonial era Bao’an Hospital, hidden behind a row of shops in central Yuanlin. View Image Details The back of the former Bao’an Hospital in Yuanlin. When this was constructed in the 1930s it was the tallest building in town. Hidden behind the busy thoroughfares at the heart of downtown Yuanlin is the impressive Bǎo’ān Hospital ( 保安醫院 ), built in 1936 by Céng Chūnquán ( 曾春泉 ), a doctor educated at the Taiwan Governor-General’s Office Medical School ( 臺灣總督府醫學校 ; now the National Taiwan University School of Medicine 國立臺灣大學醫學院 ). Four storeys in height, it was the tallest building in town when it was finished, but it is no longer visible from the street. Modern shops have colonized what would have been an impressive front yard many decades ago, and the former entrance to the hospital has been completely enclosed; access is only possible from an alleyway around back. View Image Details The former residence of the mayor of Yuanlin dates back to the early Japanese colonial era. Zhāng Family Residence ( 張氏洋樓 ; also known in Japanese as the Yuanlin Mayor’s Mansion 員林街長官邸) is another historic building lost in a maze of alleyways not far from the bustling commercial streets of downtown Yuanlin. This was the first of many impressive buildings constructed by Zhāng Qīnghuá (張清華), who rose to prominence as a wealthy businessman, politician, and landowner around the turn of the century. It likely dates back to 1912, although there appears to be some uncertainty about the exact date of construction in the historic record. From the sounds of it, hardly anything happened in Yuanlin without his involvement in the latter half of the Japanese colonial era. Sadly, his most beautiful residence, Shǔyuán ( 曙園 ), was demolished in 2012. Inexplicably, it remains an empty lot across from a seedy KTV (pictured later in this article). View Image Details The main hall at Xingxian Academy, now located in Yuanlin Park. View Image Details The study halls on the right side of Xingxian Academy are still frequented by students. Xìngxián Academy ( 興賢書院 ) is a newly restored Qing dynasty era private school situated within Yuanlin Park ( 員林公園 ). It traces its history back to 1807, when a temple venerating Lord Wénchāng {文昌帝君), the god of examinations, was established at this location. This temple soon became a center of study for the surrounding area, particularly after members of the local gentry 10 raised funds to renovate the structure and formally convert it into an academy in the early 1880s. It continued to serve as a meeting place for intellectuals well into the new century despite the introduction of public schooling in the Japanese colonial period. After the war the property underlying Xingxian Academy was confiscated by the ROC government, part of extensive land reform projects, and the academy was effectively abandoned to fate. People in desperate need of housing moved in, and the structure soon became an unsightly slum 11 . Eventually the cultural value of the former academy became widely recognized, but before preservation efforts could get under way, it was almost completely destroyed in the 921 Earthquake. Following this disaster the remaining tenants were evicted (with compensation) and the academy was completely rebuilt from the ground up, opening to the public in the mid-2000s. These days it continues to provide study space in the wings—and Wenchang remains enshrined in the main hall. View Image Details Xuan Wu looms over the streets of Yuanlin at Hengwen Temple. I knew little of Taiwanese temple culture back when I was spending a lot of time in Yuanlin—so I could hardly believe my eyes when I rounded a corner and saw a giant god looming over the streets of south-central Yuanlin. This is Héngwén Temple (衡文宮), home of a 72 foot-tall statue of Xuán Wǔ ( 玄武 ), a Taoist warrior-god associated with the season of winter and the north. There is much to say about this temple so I encourage you to read my full post ; it is among the most interesting folk religious sites I have visited in Taiwan. View Image Details Traditional Taiwanese glove puppetry show on the outskirts of Yuanlin. Yuanlin is also one of the first places I saw bùdàixì ( 布袋戲 ), traditional glove puppetry often performed in Taiwanese Hokkien (not Mandarin Chinese).

I’ve documented the ruins of several such buildings around the country including: Qiáoyǒu Building (喬友大廈) in Changhua City; Qiānyuè Building (千越大樓) in Taichung; Dòuliùmén Building (斗六門大樓) in Douliu; and Fùyǒu Building (富有大樓) in Taitung City. ↩ People often ask why there are so many abandoned buildings in Taiwan, but the answer is often quite mundane: shareholders need to agree to refurbish, demolish, or sell a property, and it is fairly common for lawsuits to slow the process of determining the ultimate outcome. ↩ Dounan Railway Granary ( 斗南鐵路穀倉 ) in Yunlin (not to be confused with Yuanlin) is the other remaining grain silo in Taiwan. This granary was also derelict for many years, although it wasn’t exactly abandoned—unscrupulous operators turned it into an illegal waste dump , filling it slag and fly ash . ↩ Information about the history of this building is somewhat limited; the best I found is this blog , which gives this full name: Taichung Prefecture Fruit Industry Association Yuanlin Inspection Office (台中州青果同業組合員林檢查所). Nowadays it is officially the Yuanlin Office of the Taichung Branch of the Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (經濟部檢驗局台中分局員林辦事處). ↩ Fundraising efforts were overseen by several scholar-officials who had passed the imperial entrance examinations, achieving the rank of xiùcái ( 秀才 ). ↩ This seems to have been a common fate for many historic sites around Taiwan. Huángxī Academy (磺溪書院), just across the county line in Taichung, is another example of an academy that was left in ruins after the war and nearly destroyed by the 921 Earthquake. ↩ These blue delivery trucks are informally known as fācáichē (發財車), literally “get rich car”! They are locally manufactured by China Motor Corporation and often based on Japanese designs. ↩ Xiǎonán City God Temple (小南城隍廟) in Tainan is famous for its frequent puppet shows . Incidentally, the god who loves puppet shows is Zhu Yigui, the same anti-Qing rebel mentioned in a previous footnote! ↩ This would be the infamous Mainland Chinese-style black-skinned stinky tofu (大陸黑皮臭豆腐).

Cídé Temple 慈德宮 (also romanized as Tzude Temple) is an unusual manifestation of Taiwanese folk religion situated on a hillside overlooking the historic town of Caotun in northwestern Nantou , Taiwan . Constructed in 1984, it was inspired by the recurring dreams of a local fruit farmer, Zhāng Wénqǐ (張文杞), and funded by generous donations from the community. The main hall of the temple takes the form of a bottle gourd (葫蘆) laying on its side, and the entrance is covered by a conical bamboo farmer’s hat (斗笠). These features give the temple its peculiar shape, but they were not chosen at random; the design is inspired by ancient Chinese mythology , albeit with an idiosyncratic twist. View Image Details An oblique glance at one of the more unique temples in central Taiwan. I first visited this temple in 2015 after reading about it in an article from The Daily Bubble Tea . At the time I knew very little about Taiwanese temple culture —and hadn’t learned too much more by the time I returned for a second visit in 2017. Brief conversations with volunteers at the temple and a perusal of Chinese language blogs was enough to establish the proximate reason for this temple’s distinctive design, namely that it came from a dream. But I found this explanation somewhat unsatisfying, and was left wondering: What inspired that dream? Why the bottle gourd and farmer’s hat? Was there any deeper meaning to these choices? While drafting this article I searched high and low for a frame of reference that would help bring it all into focus—and I found it in the legend of Nǚwā Mends the Heavens (女媧補天). Nüwa is the mother goddess of ancient Chinese mythology, roughly analogous to Eve of the Abrahamic faiths . She is also the daughter of the Jade Emperor (玉皇), the highest-ranking god in the Taoist pantheon regularly found in Taiwanese temples. According to legend , she came to earth and was happy for a while, but soon yearned for company. To alleviate her loneliness Nüwa fashioned the first human beings out of riparian clay 1 and animated them with her breath. Not wanting to continue the work all by herself, she introduced the custom of marriage (and by extension, procreation), and her cherished offspring soon populated the earth 2 . Early human civilization prospered for a period of time, but catastrophe struck when the gods went to war. In most tellings the primary antagonist is the water god Gònggōng (共工), who rips a hole in the sky, knocks over one of the four cosmographic pillars holding the heavens aloft 3 , and instigates a devastating flood . Nüwa intervenes to save humankind from disaster by performing a number of miraculous acts: she melts five coloured stones representing Wǔxíng (五行), the Five Elements of classical Chinese philosophy, to form a magical liquid to seal the hole in the sky; she battles the mythical Áo ( 鰲 ), a gigantic turtle, and severs its enormous legs, using them to prop up the heavens and restore order to the world 4 ; and finally, she saves humankind from the floodwaters by packing them onto an enchanted golden bottle gourd until the deluge recedes. View Image Details The bottle gourd temple from the front. Note the golden censer; the symbolism of this is explained in the text. This temple is not directly inspired by the legend of Nüwa , nor is she venerated here 5 , but telling her story provides a relatively concise introduction to some of the traditional motifs informing the design. Let’s begin with the large golden censer 6 immediately outside the main entrance. This censer rests on the back of a golden turtle, almost certainly representing the gigantic turtle Ao , and is surrounded by the planar outline of another stylized bottle gourd. Apart from its appearances in the Nüwa myth, bottle gourds are frequently invoked as symbols of health, medicine, longevity, and even immortality 7 , but in this context there might also be a subtext of salvation . View Image Details Four pillars support the farmer’s hat. View Image Details A closer look at the painting inside the farmer’s hat. While the meaning of the bottle gourd in traditional Chinese mythology is well-established, the farmer’s hat is somewhat more mysterious—and perhaps even unique to this temple 8 . In this context it represents the heavens, for it is round and perched on four columns, an obvious reference to the cosmographic pillars of myth. A painting on the underside of the farmer’s hat depicts what appears to be the Nine Emperors (九皇大帝) of heaven, a mirror image of the legendary Nine Provinces (九州) of ancient China 9 . Every emperor is associated with an asterism (or constellation, if you prefer) faintly visible in the innermost recesses of the farmer’s hat. Finally, if you look closely you’ll also find some characters vertically inscribed between two figures; this is the painter’s signature and phone number. View Image Details A portrait of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek hanging inside the temple. View Image Details The main altar inside Cide Temple. Compared to the visual feast of the exterior, the inside of this temple is rather sparse. Most of the interior of the bottle gourd is bare concrete, a rare sight in a country where temples go all-out with woodcarvings, painted murals, ceramic dioramas, and other decorative elements. There is only one altar, but it is adorned with an impressive array of 56 idols, many of which are cloaked in orange robes. The most important of these gods are those who directed (through the dreams of the fruit farmer) the construction of this unusual temple. They are the larger gold-faced figures at the very back—and they do not appear to be enshrined anywhere else in Taiwan 10 . View Image Details The right side of the temple is decorated with dragons.

The exterior of the bottle gourd portion of the temple is decorated with dragons on the right, representing yang , and fènghuáng (鳳凰) on the left, representing yin 11 . An enormous flower, presumably a sacred lotus , is hidden behind the bottle gourd temple, but its exact meaning in this context eludes me. The hillside beyond features a pond surrounded by statues of various immortals, two golden dragons, an elephant, and more. After a short hike you’ll find the magnificent 300 year-old banyan tree from which this area gets its name 12 , and a modest shrine to the God of Land, Tǔdìgōng (土地公).

It is 30 meters tall, decorated with small statues of the 18 Arhats , and topped by a statue of Guanyin , the Goddess of Mercy. But that’s not all—after dark the eyes of the dragons light up with 20,000 watts of power, beaming into the night. Ultimately the column is meant to act as a sort of spiritual lighthouse overlooking Caotun, hence the sign at the base of the column: Heavenly Column Protecting the Country (護國天柱). View Image Details A close look at the 19 Dragon Column in front of the temple. View Image Details This column is one of the three wonders of this unusual temple in Caotun. At first glance this temple might seem ridiculous or even “creepy” (the actual term used by one foreign blogger), but a closer look reveals a site steeped in myth and meaning. Taiwanese folk religion is informed by millennia of tradition but plenty of adherents operate outside of established codes and hierarchies. Personally I find it quite fascinating how many of Taiwan’s most unusual religious and spiritual sites are the result of common people pursuing their dreams 13 . Perhaps by shining a light on the mysterious bottle gourd temple (葫蘆廟) I can awaken your curiosity and interest in exploring this obscure element of Taiwanese temple culture .

Formally known as the Canopy-Heaven Hypothesis (蓋天說), it was described in the Zhōubì Suànjīng (周髀算經), a Zhou Dynasty mathematical treatise sometimes translated as “The Gnomon of the Zhou”, but its origins are lost in prehistory. Incidentally, Siwei has an incredible number of English translations, making it a slippery subject to research. Among other examples, I’ve seen wei translated as pillars, principles, norms, cardinal virtues, social controls, and social bonds. The more archaic use of the term, in relation to the four pillars holding up the heavens, also describe cords, ropes, and poles. The reason for this is simple enough: the symbolism of four supportive structures upholding the universe is a regularly occurring theme in the culturally Chinese world. Two reformulations relevant to this inquiry are those of Confucius, who adapted Siwei to describe four principles upholding society, and Sun Yat-sen , founding father of the Republic of China, who adapted Confucian thought in his famous treatise, the Three Principles of the People .

I chanced upon the ruins of the RSEA Marble Factory (榮民大理石工廠) while riding around the industrial park on the north side of Hualien City sometime in early 2017. It wasn’t immediately obvious what this derelict factory produced so I decided to stop and take a closer look. Although much of this sprawling site had already been cleared, a few half-demolished buildings remained. In one of these I found a pallet full of product samples and several references to marble, answering the first of many questions on my mind. But there’s always more to examine if you’re curious, so let’s dig into the archives and see what can be learned about this abandoned industrial site in Hualien , Taiwan . View Image Details The gatehouse at an abandoned marble processing plant in Hualien City. In the late 1940s nearly two million Chinese Nationalist (KMT) soldiers and their dependents fled the Chinese Civil War and settled in Taiwan. Many of these people ended up in military dependents’ villages (眷村), originally intended to be temporary settlements, as “retaking the mainland” (光復大陸) continued to be a near-term goal. Following the First Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1954–1955 the reality of the stalemate began to sink in, and seeing as how there were hundreds of thousands of soldiers kicking around, the government began putting them to work on various infrastructure projects 1 . View Image Details Main office of the old marble factory. The Chinese characters are difficult to discern but two English statements are clearly visible: WELCOME TO RSEA MARBLE PLANT, VACRS and YOU CAN MEET OUR PRODUCTS AROUND THE WORLD. The Re­tired Servicemen’s Engineering Agency (RSEA) was formed from several Vocational Assistance Commission for Retired Servicemen (VACRS) working groups originally tasked with constructing the Central Cross-Island Highway in 1956 2 . Much of this highway—which remains a truly magnificent work of human engineering—runs along the Taroko Gorge (太魯閣峽谷), sometimes referred to as the “Grand Canyon of Taiwan”. Extensive marble deposits were identified while the highway was under construction, and by the late 1950s facilities were constructed in Hualien City to begin commercial exploitation of this abundant natural resource. View Image Details One of the few remaining structures on site, with a nice marble walkway in front. After the completion of the Central Cross-Island Highway in 1960 many veterans were shuffled into new industries in the Hualien area. Large-scale marble exploitation began in 1961 with the founding of the Hualien Marble Quarry, a story documented in Polished and Profitable , an article from the May 1964 edition of Taiwan Today 3 . Marble was initially used as a precursor for cement and fertilizer production, but increasing domestic demand for construction-grade marble 4 and handicrafts prompted the RSEA to expand operations on a large plot of land across from the airbase around 1965. The remnants of this marble processing complex can be seen in these photos. View Image Details Inside the ruins of an old marble factory in Hualien. This particular building dealt with the production of marble handicrafts. View Image Details FINE MARBLE, a discarded wooden showpiece shaped like the Chinese character for “stone”.

View Image Details Empty husks of a half-demolished factory on the outskirts of Hualien. View Image Details An old water tower with the Central Mountain Range in the distance. Not much is written about this marble factory after democratization in the 1990s. It was eventually transferred to the Huadong Construction Company (花東施工處), itself part of the RSEA, and finally closed in 2016. Taiwan’s accession to the WTO in 2002 was the death knell for many industries based on natural resource extraction but the Hualien marble industry continues to do a brisk trade 5 . Perhaps the workforce had aged and retired, and the plant was no longer needed. View Image Details Marble storage yard further down the highway. View Image Details Stonecutter’s vista. While the RSEA Marble Factory has already disappeared into history, Hualien County has undertaken several initiatives to preserve its legacy. Hualien Country Stone Sculptural Museum (花蓮縣石雕博物館), founded in 2001, is located further south of the industrial park in a newly redeveloped part of town next to the Port of Hualien , and features numerous works of marble art in the surrounding park.

I chanced upon the ruins of the RSEA Marble Factory (榮民大理石工廠) while riding around the industrial park on the north side of Hualien City sometime in early 2017. It wasn’t immediately obvious what this derelict factory produced so I decided to stop and take a closer look. Although much of this sprawling site had already been cleared, a few half-demolished buildings remained. In one of these I found a pallet full of product samples and several references to marble, answering the first of many questions on my mind. But there’s always more to examine if you’re curious, so let’s dig into the archives and see what can be learned about this abandoned industrial site in Hualien , Taiwan . View Image Details The gatehouse at an abandoned marble processing plant in Hualien City. In the late 1940s nearly two million Chinese Nationalist (KMT) soldiers and their dependents fled the Chinese Civil War and settled in Taiwan. Many of these people ended up in military dependents’ villages (眷村), originally intended to be temporary settlements, as “retaking the mainland” (光復大陸) continued to be a near-term goal. Following the First Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1954–1955 the reality of the stalemate began to sink in, and seeing as how there were hundreds of thousands of soldiers kicking around, the government began putting them to work on various infrastructure projects 1 . View Image Details Main office of the old marble factory. The Chinese characters are difficult to discern but two English statements are clearly visible: WELCOME TO RSEA MARBLE PLANT, VACRS and YOU CAN MEET OUR PRODUCTS AROUND THE WORLD. The Re­tired Servicemen’s Engineering Agency (RSEA) was formed from several Vocational Assistance Commission for Retired Servicemen (VACRS) working groups originally tasked with constructing the Central Cross-Island Highway in 1956 2 . Much of this highway—which remains a truly magnificent work of human engineering—runs along the Taroko Gorge (太魯閣峽谷), sometimes referred to as the “Grand Canyon of Taiwan”. Extensive marble deposits were identified while the highway was under construction, and by the late 1950s facilities were constructed in Hualien City to begin commercial exploitation of this abundant natural resource. View Image Details One of the few remaining structures on site, with a nice marble walkway in front. After the completion of the Central Cross-Island Highway in 1960 many veterans were shuffled into new industries in the Hualien area. Large-scale marble exploitation began in 1961 with the founding of the Hualien Marble Quarry, a story documented in Polished and Profitable , an article from the May 1964 edition of Taiwan Today 3 . Marble was initially used as a precursor for cement and fertilizer production, but increasing domestic demand for construction-grade marble 4 and handicrafts prompted the RSEA to expand operations on a large plot of land across from the airbase around 1965. The remnants of this marble processing complex can be seen in these photos. View Image Details Inside the ruins of an old marble factory in Hualien. This particular building dealt with the production of marble handicrafts. View Image Details FINE MARBLE, a discarded wooden showpiece shaped like the Chinese character for “stone”. Perhaps it was once on display at trade shows or in the front office. View Image Details Marble widgets on a pallet. View Image Details Presumably an old stone-cutting machine. View Image Details A set of boards for organizing workers and inventory. View Image Details Marble handling procedures. View Image Details Safety first! View Image Details Old red telephone. View Image Details Newspaper dating to October 20th, 1988. View Image Details Discarded machinery in a back room at the old marble factory. View Image Details A sidelong view of one of the few remaining buildings at the old marble factory. View Image Details Presumably a former warehouse with a single chunk of marble in the foreground. View Image Details Empty husks of a half-demolished factory on the outskirts of Hualien. View Image Details An old water tower with the Central Mountain Range in the distance. Not much is written about this marble factory after democratization in the 1990s. It was eventually transferred to the Huadong Construction Company (花東施工處), itself part of the RSEA, and finally closed in 2016. Taiwan’s accession to the WTO in 2002 was the death knell for many industries based on natural resource extraction but the Hualien marble industry continues to do a brisk trade 5 . Perhaps the workforce had aged and retired, and the plant was no longer needed. View Image Details Marble storage yard further down the highway. View Image Details Stonecutter’s vista. While the RSEA Marble Factory has already disappeared into history, Hualien County has undertaken several initiatives to preserve its legacy. Hualien Country Stone Sculptural Museum (花蓮縣石雕博物館), founded in 2001, is located further south of the industrial park in a newly redeveloped part of town next to the Port of Hualien , and features numerous works of marble art in the surrounding park. Even more marble industry heritage can be seen in the Hualien County Retired Servicemen’s Marble Cultural Park (花蓮縣榮民大理石文化園區) in Shoufeng , including 昇華 (三) , a piece formerly installed at the RSEA Marble Factory gatehouse from 1967 to 2016.

Green Bay is a forlorn stretch of sandy coastline in Wanli , a rural district of roughly 22,000 residents situated on the rugged northeastern coast of Taiwan . It is widely known for its many derelict resorts, most famously the so-called Wanli UFO Village (萬里飛碟屋), which is what initially drew me here in 2013. I returned a year later and noticed a dilapidated structure further along the beach, an unsightly institutional building similar in appearance to a Taiwanese police station of the 1980s. A closer inspection revealed an interior cluttered with intriguing artifacts and decaying documents—enough to conclusively identify this neglected ruin. This was formally known as the Yeliu Signal Station (野柳信號臺), an outpost responsible for monitoring maritime traffic in the shipping lanes and designated anchorages just west of the Port of Keelung . View Image Details The former Yeliu Signal Station from the garbage-covered beach. A fortified military bunker can be seen in front of the building. View Image Details Approaching the signal station from the highway. This would have been the main entrance while the station was in operation. View Image Details The main entrance facing the sea was sealed shut at some point—but the sliding door to the right was already wide open the first time I visited. It wasn’t immediately obvious what I had found since there are no signs posted anywhere outside the building—but it wasn’t long before the pieces of the puzzle started falling into place. After stepping inside I soon discovered a rusty cabinet containing stacks of logbooks. A quick perusal of these weathered tomes established the maritime connection; each page noted the date, time, position, callsign, and identifying features of passing ships. View Image Details A cabinet on the ground floor filled with years of logbooks. View Image Details Every logbook records ships entering or exiting the Port of Keelung. Why these were abandoned here and not relocated is a mystery. The second floor of the station featured living quarters sufficient for a small family. Presumably the chief communications officer resided here, although there’s always a chance someone else moved in after the station was decommissioned. In any case, whoever was stationed here abandoned most of their personal possessions when they left. I am always vaguely unsettled when I wander into rooms like these, which look very much like someone just got up and left one day. I sometimes wonder what terrible event transpired that would cause someone to leave in such a hurry, but the truth is almost certainly more mundane—whoever departed probably didn’t want any of this junk. View Image Details Ascending the stairs, surrounded by the stench of decay. View Image Details The second floor is mostly occupied by living quarters. View Image Details A creepy doll on a chair in the abandoned signal station. View Image Details The bedrooms were a complete disaster zone. Why was so much stuff left behind?

View Image Details Taiwanese pin-up girl circa 1982. Two calendars on the second floor neatly establish the likely period of occupancy, from 1982 until sometime around February 2005. I haven’t had much luck figuring out exactly when this station was constructed, but it seems certain it was operating in the early 1980s, and might have been built in the late 1970s or even earlier. I’ve only found one reference to this place online—from the public record of a demolition project awarded in 2015 and completed in 2016 1 . Although I haven’t returned to the site in a while, it is no longer visible on Google Street View, so it seems this place has already vanished into history. What you are seeing here no longer exists . View Image Details The view from the third floor, where the business of monitoring passing ships was conducted. If you look closely you can see an empty container ship on the horizon through the window just right of center. Also note the crumpled ROC flag on the floor. Without any other primary sources to consult we are left to infer much of the history of this humble signal station . Consider this: the Port of Keelung was one of the busiest ports in the world from the 1960s until sometime in the 1980s. As late as 1984 it was still ranking in the top ten busiest ports by cargo volume 2 , meaning a good chunk of global shipping passed through these waters. Although it doesn’t look like much, the Yeliu Signal Station bore witness to the final years of the Taiwan Miracle , the period of rapid industrialization and explosive economic growth that transformed Taiwan into the highly developed nation it is today. View Image Details There is no hope of restoring this set of negatives but I felt compelled to photograph them anyway. In 1989 the Legislative Yuan approved the construction of a modern, centralized vessel traffic service for the Port of Keelung, replacing the existing network of signal stations 3 . The new control tower was completed in the late 1990s, underwent extensive testing, and officially entered into service in 1999 4 . This rendered the Yeliu Signal Station obsolete, but I would hazard a guess that both systems continued to operate simultaneously, for a time. Eventually the old signal station was decommissioned, and sometime after 2005 the tenants were presumably evicted, leaving it exposed to the harsh winds and incessant rain of the northeastern coast.

The third floor was almost certainly where the radio control panels and other communication gear was installed, but no trace of anything electronic remained when I visited. In fact, the room was almost stripped bare, apart from two broken wooden desks covered with an assortment of reference manuals, textbooks, magazines, and other documents, several of which are itemized here: A notepad (記事簿) specifically designed for use by this station.

With a few parting shots from the observation deck I finished my exploration, made an exit, and wandered over to check out the Futuro and Venturo homes next door. Although the “UFO village” is quite cool, and rightfully popular among bloggers and tourists alike, I am somewhat surprised how little attention the signal station received while it was still around.

Day three of cycling down the Huādōng Valley 花東縱谷 began with a hearty Taiwanese breakfast not far from the train station in Fenglin , Hualien . I was still recovering from a brush with heatstroke (a story documented in the previous entry in this series ) so a traditional breakfast of dànbǐng 蛋餅 (pan-fried egg rolls) and sweet black tea really hit the spot. A glance at the weather forecast indicated another full day of sunny skies and 35°C temperatures on the road—and even fewer opportunities for air-conditioned rest stops. I wasn’t too worried though; my loosely-planned itinerary of former Shinto shrines, industrial ruins, and other historic sites didn’t look all that challenging. Ultimately I ended up putting 60 kilometers of valley behind me, ending the day in Yuli . View Image Details Rise and shine at Fenglin Station 鳳林車站 with the Central Mountain Range in the background. View Image Details Another look at the former Taihe Theater, profiled in the previous entry in this series . View Image Details A parting shot of central Fenglin with a signpost showing the way to Taitung (south) and Hualien (north). View Image Details The Confucius shrine at Fenglin Elementary School, formerly a repository for Japanese colonial relics. View Image Details A glimpse inside the Confucius shrine reveals a copy of a student’s examination admittance slip. Before leaving town I made a brief stop at Fenglin Elementary School 鳳林國小, founded in the midst of the Japanese colonial era in 1920. The advent of the Kōminka Movement in the late 1930s ushered in a new stage of Japanization, and the school elected to construct a hō-an-den (Chinese: fèng’āndiàn 奉安殿 ), a small pavilion designed to safely house a copy of the Imperial Rescript on Education and a photograph of the emperor and empress 1 . Back in the day it would have been customary for students to bow before this shrine while filing into class, and at least once a year a ceremony would be held where the text of the rescript would be recited. In 1950, only a few years after the Japanese surrender and expulsion from Taiwan, the original pavilion was destroyed and converted into a Confucius Temple 孔廟, apparently the only one on school grounds in all of Hualien County. The tradition of an annual ceremony at this shrine continues in the form of an event honoring Teacher’s Day, the birthday of Confucius , every September 28th. View Image Details Crossing the Wanli River around 9am. The Central Mountain Range is in the background and a power pole related to a nearby electrical substation is plainly visible. View Image Details A monument to a fallen local hero by the side of the highway in southern Fenglin. Crossing the Wànlǐ River 萬里溪 on Provincial Highway 9 , I soon passed a gleaming white obelisk, the Righteous Zhōng Ruìlóng Monument 義人鍾瑞龍君紀念碑. This monument commemorates the heroic acts of a young forestry bureau worker who perished saving several people from a flood after Typhoon Nora 颱風娜拉 struck in 1973. Since he had no children, the townspeople decided to honor his sacrifice with a modest stone stelae, erected the year after the disaster. When the highway was widened the old monument had to be moved—and the local government opted to fund the construction of a new monument, seen here. Apparently the old stone stelae can still be found nearby, but I didn’t notice it as I continued south under the increasingly hostile sun. View Image Details An abandoned military garrison overlooking the southern exit of the Guangfu Tunnel. All such guard posts were abolished in 1992. I soon crossed the Mǎ’ān River 馬鞍溪 and entered Guangfu . On the north bank of the river the railway line descends into Guangfu Tunnel 光復隧道 , completed in 1981 to alleviate engineering problems related to the river’s unusually high sediment load 2 . Overlooking the southern exit of the railway tunnel is one of many abandoned military bases of the 301st Bridges and Tunnels Division 東警部301橋隧連 under the Taiwan Garrison Command 臺灣警備總司令部 , a secret police force abolished in 1992. The ruins of such former sentry posts can be found at strategic locations all along the Huadong Valley but this is one of the most complete 3 . View Image Details The impressive Matai’an Church of the Conversion of St. Paul on the north side of Guangfu. View Image Details Amis woodcarvings at the entrance to the Matai’an Old House, which dates back to the 1920s. Guangfu 4 encompasses two villages of vital importance to the Amis People 阿美族 : Fata’an 馬太鞍 , which is located just east of the eponymous Guangfu Station 光復車站 , and Tafalong 太巴塱 , situated on the east side of the valley. Both settlements have gone to some lengths to preserve traditional Amis culture, but I was mostly unaware of this while riding around town (and would love to return some day to learn more). Somewhere on the north side of town I stopped to check out the Matai’an Old House 馬太鞍古屋 , a wooden structure originally built in 1929 5 . Tours appear to be available, but only by appointment. Aside from that, it was impossible to miss the Matai’an Church of the Conversion of St. Paul 馬太鞍聖保祿歸化堂, a testament to the prevalence of Christianity among the majority Indigenous population of the area. Only around 1% of Taiwanese are Catholic adherents but here in Hualien County that figure exceeds 10%. View Image Details A derelict office of the Forestry Bureau in central Guangfu. I went for a short spin around town hoping to find some trace of Guangfu’s historic movie theaters 6 but came up empty. While poking around I chanced upon the abandoned Guangfu Workstation 光復工作站, an outpost of the Forestry Bureau 林務局 ( 中文 ). Commercial logging activity decreased throughout the 1980s and was finally banned in the early 1990s, putting tens of thousands of people out of work (a theme discussed in the previous entry in this series ). The collapse of the forestry sector is a major driver of demographic changes in eastern Taiwan; mass emigration has caused the population of most towns in the valley to drop by 50% from their peak in the booming years of the 1960s and 1970s. That being said, forestry isn’t the only industry that vanished from Guangfu; sugarcane cultivation and sugar production were also a big source of employment in this part of the valley. View Image Details A lone chimney towers over the Hualien Sugar Factory. View Image Details A Chiang Kai-shek statue still stands in front of the main office of the Hualien Sugar Factory ( 花蓮糖廠辦公室 ). The inscription reads “eternal leader” (yǒngxiàng lǐngxiù 永像領袖 ). View Image Details A “safety first” ( 安全第一 ) warning posted over a sugarcane shredding machine. Heading south I made a brief detour to explore the Hualien Sugar Factory 花蓮糖廠 , initially established in 1921. It was heavily damaged by American bombing in World War II , a consequence of also producing ethanol for the Japanese war effort 7 . In the post-war era it was incorporated into the state-owned Taiwan Sugar Corporation and rebuilt. Significant expansion took place in 1975 and again in 1989 but a long-term downtrend in global sugar prices and Taiwan’s accession to the World Trade Organization led to the closure of the factory in 2002. Nowadays it has become one of the primary tourist attractions in the area, offering an eclectic assortment of sights, goods, and experiences. Taisugar’s in-house ice cream is especially popular with visitors but I amused myself by photographing the old machinery. The south end of the complex is also home to an impressive set of well-preserved Japanese dormitories (花蓮糖廠日式建築群) originally built for factory workers. Several of these have been converted into restaurants and gift shops (and even a bed and breakfast, if I recall correctly). View Image Details A relic of the vast network of sugar railways that used to extend across most of Taiwan. The sign says stop, look, and listen ( 停看聽 ).

View Image Details One of many old Japanese dormitories south of the sugar factory. Many of these have been renovated and converted into tourist attractions but this one maintains its original appearance. I stopped at the 7-Eleven leading out of Guangfu, knowing I wouldn’t see another air-conditioned convenience store for the next 18 kilometers of riding. Road conditions rapidly declined beyond the sugar factory; the highway was undergoing extensive repairs and clouds of cloying dust were suspended beneath the oppressive midday sun anywhere a car or truck had passed. My progress was slow, but I soon arrived in Dàfù 大富 (formerly Yamato 大和 , a distinctly Japanese name), a small settlement founded by the Japanese to develop the surrounding area for sugarcane cultivation. At its peak in the 1940s this town allegedly had a population of 6,000 and a bustling old street lined with hotels, pharmacies, teahouses, and even a movie theater 8 , but almost none of that remains today. In fact, I saw hardly a soul while riding around town to see what might be found. The unmanned Dafu Station 大富車站 is one of the least trafficked on the entire railway network, ranking 237th in passenger volume in 2018, serving an average of a dozen passengers per day 9 . Not far from here I chanced upon the derelict Dafu Public Elementary School 大富國民小學, mothballed in 2014 due to a lack of young people in the area. Empty schools and disused railway stations are both symptomatic of the demographic changes reshaping eastern Taiwan. View Image Details Inside the abolished Dafu Station.

View Image Details An unexpected find: the derelict Dafu Elementary School. I soon crossed an almost imperceptible boundary between watersheds while entering Fùyuán Village 富源村 in Ruisui . North of here everything drains into the Hualien River 花蓮溪 , but here in the central valley all rainwater eventually flows into the Xiùgūluán River 秀姑巒溪 , which snakes through canyons etched into the Coastal Mountain Range 海岸山脈 and exits to the east. I headed west to locate the ruins of the Bázi Shinto Shrine 拔子社 (later renamed Shirakawa Shrine 白川神社), originally built on the mountainside northwest of town in 1933 10 . Not much remains of this shrine apart from the visiting path and a single stone lantern. The site is heavily overgrown and there is an empty tomb in a vaguely Baroque Revival style where the main shrine would have been located. This tomb was abandoned after the family who built it endured some misfortune or another; the placement of burial sites is believed to have real-world consequences, and evidently they were compelled to relocate the remains of their ancestors to improve their luck. View Image Details The only intact stone lantern at the former Shinto shrine in Fuyuan Village. View Image Details Ascending the overgrown visiting path. View Image Details The abandoned tomb at the top of the stairway. Further south in central Ruisui I resumed the theater hunt 11 . Ruisui Theater 瑞穗戲院 was founded in the 1940s but was destroyed in a fire shortly thereafter. In response, the local farming association converted a warehouse into a temporary cinema, which is how the Nóngmín Theater 農民戲院 (literally “Farmer’s Theater”) was born. Later this site was redeveloped into a proper movie theater with a capacity of 550 and renamed Chéngdū Theater 成都戲院. It was in business at least until the early 1980s, and after shutting down it was eventually converted into an outpost of the Tǒngguān Supermarket 統冠聯合超市 (Tkmart) chain around 2009. I wandered in to take a look around but it didn’t look anything like a theater so I’m not entirely sure any part of the original structure has been preserved. Ruisui also had a second cinema, Jīnlóng Theater 金龍戲院, originally located on Guóguāng North Road 國光北路, but it was demolished and replaced by a furniture store long ago.

At this point it was sometime after four in the afternoon. The sun was hanging low in the sky, shadows were growing long, and the ambient temperature was finally becoming tolerable. On a previous trip I had taken Provincial Highway 9 from Yuli to Ruisui so I decided to try a different route: County Road 193, which runs along the east side of the valley. I left central Ruisui and crossed a bridge spanning the Xiuguluan River, renowned for its whitewater rafting , and entered the northernmost extent of Yuli Township . The road soon curved south and winded its way along the river terraces overlooking an exceptionally scenic expanse of rice paddies. One segment of this road, the Chūnrì Green Tunnel 春日綠色隧道, is also lined with trees. Without a doubt, this was the most gorgeous part of riding down the Huadong Valley on this particular day.

It obviously commemorated something related to the ROC Armed Forces , but it wasn’t until I transcribed the inscription 12 in the months following the trip that I learned what it truly signifies. Although its exact date of construction is unclear, this stone stelae honors Sergeant Gǔ Zhènyà 谷振亞, who was swept away by a flood in 1952 while assisting in the construction of the Tàipíng Canal 太平渠, a 24 kilometer-long irrigation channel running through this part of the valley. His body was never found, and while his sacrifice was not immediately forgotten, the monument was eventually overgrown with weeds and barely legible. Only in 2017 did a local painter and his son take it upon themselves to restore the monument, a story documented in news reports like this one . The irrigation channel Sergeant Gu helped build is still in use—and in fact, it is probably the source of much of the water used to irrigate the rice fields in these photographs. View Image Details Dusky skies over the rice paddies of the central Huadong Valley. With dusk settling over the valley I knew it was time to seek shelter in central Yuli—but I couldn’t resist one last detour. I crossed back to the west side of the valley by way of Gāoliáo Bridge 高寮大橋 and headed for the tiny hamlet of Dàyǔ 大禹, named after the legendary Chinese ruler Yu the Great . In the Japanese colonial era this settlement was named Suehiro 末廣, a distinctly Japanese name, which should explain why it was renamed when the KMT arrived and implemented policies of Sinicization . Despite its diminutive size this village had a train station (built in 1917 and abolished in 1995) and a Shinto shrine (formally 末廣神社). I visited both, but there really wasn’t much of anything left; the railway station was the same design as several others already documented here and the Shinto shrine was replaced by a small temple venerating the God of Land, Tǔ Dì Gōng 土地公 .

Night descended just as I arrived at the outskirts of Yuli. I had spent most of the day on country roads so it felt great to return to something that really felt like a city , however small it might be compared to the urban agglomerations of western Taiwan. Before checking into a hotel 13 I stopped to try the local specialty, Yuli noodles 玉里麵, at a famous hole-in-the-wall eatery . I have to admit that I’m not a noodle connoisseur so I can’t really tell you what makes this dish so remarkable, but it was definitely delicious. With big pieces of pork served on top of strong pork bone soup stock it reminded me of ramen—if ramen were made with some of the most iconic elements of street-side Taiwanese cuisine anyway. View Image Details Last railway crossing on the way into Yuli. View Image Details A bowl of the local specialty. Overall it was a more relaxed day on the road than the previous two. Despite the peculiarity of the hotel I had chosen I ended up getting a better night’s rest than before, which meant I was recharged for the ride to Guanshan . I’ll have more about that segment of the ride next time around; until then, feel welcome to browse the series index to see what I’ve already published from this six-day trip down the Huadong Valley. All schools in Japanese Taiwan possessed copies of the imperial photographs and rescript, but they were usually housed in special safes in the principal’s office.

Day three of cycling down the Huādōng Valley 花東縱谷 began with a hearty Taiwanese breakfast not far from the train station in Fenglin , Hualien . I was still recovering from a brush with heatstroke (a story documented in the previous entry in this series ) so a traditional breakfast of dànbǐng 蛋餅 (pan-fried egg rolls) and sweet black tea really hit the spot. A glance at the weather forecast indicated another full day of sunny skies and 35°C temperatures on the road—and even fewer opportunities for air-conditioned rest stops. I wasn’t too worried though; my loosely-planned itinerary of former Shinto shrines, industrial ruins, and other historic sites didn’t look all that challenging. Ultimately I ended up putting 60 kilometers of valley behind me, ending the day in Yuli . View Image Details Rise and shine at Fenglin Station 鳳林車站 with the Central Mountain Range in the background.

View Image Details A glimpse inside the Confucius shrine reveals a copy of a student’s examination admittance slip. Before leaving town I made a brief stop at Fenglin Elementary School 鳳林國小, founded in the midst of the Japanese colonial era in 1920. The advent of the Kōminka Movement in the late 1930s ushered in a new stage of Japanization, and the school elected to construct a hō-an-den (Chinese: fèng’āndiàn 奉安殿 ), a small pavilion designed to safely house a copy of the Imperial Rescript on Education and a photograph of the emperor and empress 1 . Back in the day it would have been customary for students to bow before this shrine while filing into class, and at least once a year a ceremony would be held where the text of the rescript would be recited. In 1950, only a few years after the Japanese surrender and expulsion from Taiwan, the original pavilion was destroyed and converted into a Confucius Temple 孔廟, apparently the only one on school grounds in all of Hualien County. The tradition of an annual ceremony at this shrine continues in the form of an event honoring Teacher’s Day, the birthday of Confucius , every September 28th.

Crossing the Wànlǐ River 萬里溪 on Provincial Highway 9 , I soon passed a gleaming white obelisk, the Righteous Zhōng Ruìlóng Monument 義人鍾瑞龍君紀念碑. This monument commemorates the heroic acts of a young forestry bureau worker who perished saving several people from a flood after Typhoon Nora 颱風娜拉 struck in 1973. Since he had no children, the townspeople decided to honor his sacrifice with a modest stone stelae, erected the year after the disaster. When the highway was widened the old monument had to be moved—and the local government opted to fund the construction of a new monument, seen here. Apparently the old stone stelae can still be found nearby, but I didn’t notice it as I continued south under the increasingly hostile sun. View Image Details An abandoned military garrison overlooking the southern exit of the Guangfu Tunnel. All such guard posts were abolished in 1992. I soon crossed the Mǎ’ān River 馬鞍溪 and entered Guangfu . On the north bank of the river the railway line descends into Guangfu Tunnel 光復隧道 , completed in 1981 to alleviate engineering problems related to the river’s unusually high sediment load 2 . Overlooking the southern exit of the railway tunnel is one of many abandoned military bases of the 301st Bridges and Tunnels Division 東警部301橋隧連 under the Taiwan Garrison Command 臺灣警備總司令部 , a secret police force abolished in 1992. The ruins of such former sentry posts can be found at strategic locations all along the Huadong Valley but this is one of the most complete 3 .

View Image Details Amis woodcarvings at the entrance to the Matai’an Old House, which dates back to the 1920s. Guangfu 4 encompasses two villages of vital importance to the Amis People 阿美族 : Fata’an 馬太鞍 , which is located just east of the eponymous Guangfu Station 光復車站 , and Tafalong 太巴塱 , situated on the east side of the valley. Both settlements have gone to some lengths to preserve traditional Amis culture, but I was mostly unaware of this while riding around town (and would love to return some day to learn more). Somewhere on the north side of town I stopped to check out the Matai’an Old House 馬太鞍古屋 , a wooden structure originally built in 1929 5 . Tours appear to be available, but only by appointment. Aside from that, it was impossible to miss the Matai’an Church of the Conversion of St. Paul 馬太鞍聖保祿歸化堂, a testament to the prevalence of Christianity among the majority Indigenous population of the area. Only around 1% of Taiwanese are Catholic adherents but here in Hualien County that figure exceeds 10%. View Image Details A derelict office of the Forestry Bureau in central Guangfu. I went for a short spin around town hoping to find some trace of Guangfu’s historic movie theaters 6 but came up empty. While poking around I chanced upon the abandoned Guangfu Workstation 光復工作站, an outpost of the Forestry Bureau 林務局 ( 中文 ). Commercial logging activity decreased throughout the 1980s and was finally banned in the early 1990s, putting tens of thousands of people out of work (a theme discussed in the previous entry in this series ). The collapse of the forestry sector is a major driver of demographic changes in eastern Taiwan; mass emigration has caused the population of most towns in the valley to drop by 50% from their peak in the booming years of the 1960s and 1970s. That being said, forestry isn’t the only industry that vanished from Guangfu; sugarcane cultivation and sugar production were also a big source of employment in this part of the valley.

Heading south I made a brief detour to explore the Hualien Sugar Factory 花蓮糖廠 , initially established in 1921. It was heavily damaged by American bombing in World War II , a consequence of also producing ethanol for the Japanese war effort 7 . In the post-war era it was incorporated into the state-owned Taiwan Sugar Corporation and rebuilt. Significant expansion took place in 1975 and again in 1989 but a long-term downtrend in global sugar prices and Taiwan’s accession to the World Trade Organization led to the closure of the factory in 2002. Nowadays it has become one of the primary tourist attractions in the area, offering an eclectic assortment of sights, goods, and experiences. Taisugar’s in-house ice cream is especially popular with visitors but I amused myself by photographing the old machinery. The south end of the complex is also home to an impressive set of well-preserved Japanese dormitories (花蓮糖廠日式建築群) originally built for factory workers. Several of these have been converted into restaurants and gift shops (and even a bed and breakfast, if I recall correctly).

In any case, the restaurant is by appointment only, and since I hadn’t called ahead, there was nobody around to answer any of my questions when I visited. ↩ Taiwan Railways Administration maintains a list of passenger and cargo volume by station but the URL often changes and I’ve had some trouble pulling up the official list. This mirror dates back to 2018 and provides the basis for the claim that Dafu Station is one of the least utilized on the entire railway system. ↩ More information about this particular Shinto shrine can be found here . ↩ This article (in Chinese) features some useful information about the theater history of Guangfu, Ruisui, and Yuli. ↩ The full inscription in Chinese reads: 故陸軍中士谷振亞紀念碑. ↩ Whereas I had enjoyed staying in a local hotel in Fenglin the previous night I had some trouble finding similar lodging in Yuli. Not wanting to mess around any more than necessary, I booked a place on Airbnb that turned out to be overpriced and oddly designed. Never know what you’ll get when you rent online in Taiwan—which is why I always prefer to stay in vintage small town hotels wherever I can find them. ↩

This post is the final entry in a series documenting several days of riding around Nantou in October 2015. On the last morning of this trip I woke in Puli , close to the geographic center of Taiwan . I only had to return the scooter to the rental shop in Taichung sometime after nightfall so I decided to take a more circuitous route and check out many sights along the way. After a quick breakfast I headed south, briefly stopping by the shores of the majestic Sun Moon Lake (日月潭, covered in the previous entry in this series ), and ascended a winding mountain access road leading into Xinyi , one of several majority Taiwanese Indigenous districts in this landlocked county. View Image Details The gateway to Xinyi Township along a mountain road leading south from Sun Moon Lake. View Image Details Roselle by the roadside. View Image Details A group of farmers harvesting roselle in Nantan Village. View Image Details Neat and orderly trash and recycling depot somewhere along a back country road. Tánnán Village (潭南村) is the first village south of the lake—and its name in Chinese means exactly that, literally “lake south”. It is home to the eponymous Tannan community (潭南部落), part of the Takibakha group (卡社群) of the indigenous Bunun people 1 . The community is scattered along County Road 63, which twists its way down the mountainside to the river valley below. Here I made a pitstop to observe local residents harvesting the fleshy pink fruits of Hibiscus sabdariffa , the roselle plant (洛神花). I have become quite fond of the roselle tea commonly found in night markets around Taiwan so it was interesting to learn where it is normally cultivated. View Image Details Descending to the Zhoushui River along Nantou County Road 63. County Road 63 merges with Provincial Highway 16 on the north bank of the sluggish Zhuoshui River , the longest in the nation at 186 kilometers in length. Heading west toward the coastal plains, I soon encountered the remains of the Qīngyún Suspension Bridge ( 青雲吊橋 ), which dates back to 1980. The river appears placid in these photos but disastrous landslides and floods are not uncommon in this part of the country, especially when typhoons sweep over the central mountains. Details are scant, but it would appear as if this particular bridge wasn’t destroyed in any disaster; it was simply replaced by a newer, wider bridge, and dismantled not long after I passed through. I’m not sure what explains the dilapidated appearance—perhaps it was in the process of being stripped down when I passed through? View Image Details Cactus is a somewhat unusual sight in this part of Taiwan, particularly one so large growing on the side of a bridge! View Image Details The abandoned Qingyun Suspension Bridge spanning the Zhoushui River. Emblazoned on the pylon are the characters for the Bōshí Community ( 波石社區 ), a tiny hamlet on the opposite shore. View Image Details Not much left of this old bridge (and soon it would be gone forever). After following the winding road on the opposite bank of the river I arrived at Rénlún Village (人倫村), a Bunun settlement of the Takbanuaz group (巒社群) 2 . I wasn’t able to uncover too much about the history of the village, but it seems likely this Indigenous community was resettled in this vicinity here sometime in the 1920s or early 1930s, and the village, now perched on a hillside, occupies a site chosen in 1949. View Image Details A mural on one of many slopes in Renlun Village. Perhaps it depicts the millet harvest? View Image Details A typical street view in Renlun Village. The entire settlement is perched on a hillside overlooking the Zhoushui River. View Image Details Rénhé Elementary School ( 人和國小 ) still bears the former name of the village. Here schoolchildren are returning to class after recess. Without realizing it, I had entered the village from the far side; soon I found myself at the foot of the distinctive Rénlún Bridge (人倫橋), ordinarily the first glimpse of the eponymous village for visitors and returning residents. This bridge, which also spans the Zhoushui River, is adorned with dozens of sculptures depicting a double-headed Taiwanese wild boar (shānzhū 山豬, formally Sus scrofa taivanus ), an icon of Bunun culture 3 . View Image Details Double-headed boars line this distinctive bridge leading into (or out from) Renlun Village. View Image Details A decommissioned M48A3 tank near the entrance to Renlun Village. View Image Details The faded emblem of the KMT and, by extension, the ROC Armed Forces. At the foot of this bridge one will also find an old M48 Patton tank (巴頓坦克), specifically the M48A3 model, which was either made or retrofitted here in Taiwan. These tanks were probably decommissioned in the 1980s and I haven’t the slightest idea what this one is doing here. Observe the faded emblem; this is the Blue Sky with a White Sun (靑天白日旗) of the Kuomintang and, by extension, the ROC Armed Forces . View Image Details The remains of an old road down by the riverside. On the left are the reinforced concrete pylons of Renlun Bridge. View Image Details On a road to nowhere. While crossing the river I noticed something interesting along the northern shore. Descending along a small access point on the far side, I went to investigate, and found the heavily eroded and fragmented remains of a paved road running along the riverside. Sleuthing around on Google Maps reveals several other sections of roadway along this stretch of river, and the presence of yellow dividing lines suggest it was open to regular traffic at some point. I surmise this was a temporary bypass road constructed in the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot (颱風莫拉克) in 2009 while repairs were conducted on the main highway, but this is mere conjecture. It also could have been constructed for gravel extraction; there is a large mining operation around the next bend in the river. View Image Details An incredible vista overlooking a bend in the Zhoushui River. If you look closely you can see the highway from the previous photos dissolving into the riverbed. Back on Highway 16, I continued into Shuili , but made a brief detour to scope out the Shuili Snake Kiln , partly because of the intriguing name. This kiln was firing pottery as far back as 1927 and derives its moniker from its serpentine shape, which channels heat up the body of the “snake”. Unfortunately the kiln collapsed in the devastating 921 Earthquake of 1999, a disaster that left scars all over this part of the country. The kiln was rebuilt and transformed into a tourist attraction in the years that followed, almost certainly with government assistance. I ended up devoting an entire post to it, so follow this link if you’d like to read more about the snake kiln! View Image Details Overlooking the reconstructed Shuili Snake Kiln. The entire structure is on a slight incline so that heat rises and flows through the body of the “snake”, firing whatever pottery has been left inside. View Image Details An old building on a bend in Provincial Highway 16 in Shuili. I’m not sure what it would have been, but there’s a derelict factory behind and to the left of it, so perhaps it was the front office. Shuili is home to approximately 18,000 residents, most of whom are concentrated in a sizeable settlement sprawling along a river terrace on the north side of the Zhoushui River. Although it is the gateway to Sun Moon Lake and parts beyond, few tourists stop here for anything other than a quick snack, typically bawan (肉圓). Historically, Shuili was an important center of the camphor and lumber trades, and a staging point for the many hydroelectric projects previously discussed in this series . View Image Details The oversize Shuili Railway Station, the penultimate stop on the Jiji Line. View Image Details A Japanese colonial government office building next to Shuili Station. It was recently designated a historic property and awaits some kind of restoration work. Is that the remains of a white sun emblem tacked onto the top of the facade? One legacy of all this industrial activity is the Jíjí Line (集集線), a railway spur completed in 1922. It branches off the West Coast Line (縱貫線) at Ershui in Changhua and terminates at Chēchéng Station (車埕車站), approximately 2 kilometers into the mountains north of Shuili Station (水里車站). The railway station building itself is not so old, but just next door you’ll find the Japanese colonial era Shuili Police Substation (水里分駐所). It was designated a heritage property in 2015 and now awaits restoration 4 . View Image Details Wandering through the old logging village of Checheng. View Image Details Stopping for a bite at one of the famous wooden lunchbox shops in Checheng. View Image Details Heading back to the scooter and appreciating the immensity of the mountains rising on all sides. Since I was making good time I made a small detour into the mountains to grab lunch in Chēchéng Village (車埕村). My usual spot next to the railway station was closed so I wandered up Mínquán Lane (民權巷) and sampled a bento box at the Checheng Eatery (車埕小飯店). This shop is one of several offering wooden bento boxes, a throwback to when this was a company town dominated by Zhènchāng Lumber Industries (振昌木業), which relocated most of their operations to Fengyuan in the late 1980s. The village was rehabilitated as a major tourist attraction in the early 2000s and now welcomes hundreds of thousands of visitors every year 5 . View Image Details The serene Cide Monastery on the outskirts of Shuili. I exited Shuili by way of County Road 27, an older route that follows the contours of the rolling hills overlooking the ever-present river. I noticed an interesting páifāng (牌坊, gateway) while passing through an area known as Yóuchēkēng (油車坑) and elected to take a closer look. This turned out to be the scenic Cídé Monastery (慈德寺), a beautiful Buddhist-style temple attached to one of only a handful of crematoriums in this part of the country. It has quite a history, and has been in business at this location since the early 1960s 6 . It was one of countless structures damaged beyond repair in 1999 and was completely rebuilt, hence why it looks so new. View Image Details The earthquake-damaged Wuchang Temple, now the Jiji 921 Earthquake Memorial ( 集集九二一地震紀念館 ). Descending into Jiji with an eye on the clock, I revisited Wǔchāng Temple (武昌宮), another temple destroyed by the big quake. It was founded in 1923 and moved to this site in 1990, after which construction began on a more modern reinforced concrete structure. Disaster struck mere months after it opened to the public in 1999 and the temple collapsed. Rather than clear the ruins the temple was preserved as a memorial—and an impressive new temple was constructed next door with the generous donations that came pouring in after 921. If you’re interested in seeing more of this collapsed temple (and its opulent replacement), follow this link . View Image Details A somewhat less serene shrine to the Four-Faced Buddha next to the Thirteen Eye Kiln in Jiji. While exiting Jiji to the west I swung by the Thirteen Eye Kiln (十三目仔窯). Much like the Shuili Snake Kiln, this one was also destroyed by the 921 Earthquake, but it wasn’t reconstructed. You would be forgiven for assuming, as I did, that the body of the kiln was converted into a bunch of shops selling trinkets and souvenirs, but this is merely a structure inspired by the original kiln, which is little more than a pile of rubble off to one side. The site is quite extensive, however, and you’ll find a wild assortment of quirky shrines and novelty vendors in this tacky tourist trap 7 . I noticed one new feature since my last visit to the site: a shrine to the Four-Faced Buddha (四面佛), better known as Phra Phrom , a Thai incarnation of the Hindu deity Brahma . Such shrines have been sprouting up all over Taiwan in recent years, a consequence of the growing popularity of the original location 8 in Taipei . View Image Details A pair of tanks on display next to Longquan Station and the eastern terminus of the Jiji Green Tunnel. Left: M18; right: M24. View Image Details A much clearer iteration of the KMT emblem on the M18 tank. Next to Lóngquán Station (龍泉車站) and the eastern terminus of the Jiji Green Tunnel (集集綠色隧道) one will find a pair of tanks on display. The one on the left is an M18 Hellcat , manufactured for action in World War 2 and discontinued in 1944. Several hundred M18s were sold to the Republic of China in 1952, part of the first round of American military aid given to the KMT after their retreat to Taiwan. The tank on the right is an M24 Chaffee , another WW2-era design, although there is some chance it could be a variant known as the M24A1, which was in service in Taiwan until the late 1990s. The proximity to an enormous military base in the mountains behind the railway station is probably no accident. View Image Details This leaning power pole is a memorial to the devastating 921 Earthquake of 1999. View Image Details A quirky sign for Tea Fingers Story House ( 茶二指故事館 ), a roadside attraction on Highway 139. Darkness gathered as I rode through the camphor trees lining County Road 152. Soon I passed into Mingjian and the Nantou 921 Earthquake Leaning Tower Memorial Site (南投九二一地震斜塔紀念地), visible from Provincial Highway 16 if you know where to look. If I’m not mistaken, this transmission tower was knocked to one side by soil liquefaction . There is a small park surrounding the remains of the tower but I didn’t stop long enough for a closer look on this trip. Dusk was settling over the countryside and I still had a lot of driving to do. View Image Details Out in the tea fields of Mingjian, not far from where I was stung by a bee (or whatever). Rather than descend to the rural-industrial sprawl of the Changhua Plain (彰化平原) I opted to head for County Highway 139, which runs the length of Bāguàshān (八卦山), a rocky ridge-line that forms much of the border between Nantou and Changhua. Here, while riding through the hazy tea fields, I experienced a novel physical sensation: a sudden, sharp pain on my exposed leg that might have been a bee sting. I reached down and dislodged a small, black object, initially assuming this to be a piece of glass or grit, but perhaps it was a stinger. Within moments I was overcome by excruciating pain and had to pull over to make a contingency plan. I’ve never been stung but several of my relatives are extremely allergic to bees—and here I was in some unremarkable expanse of countryside, with no help in sight. Several anxious moments followed as I continued north, climbed into the hills, and made it to the nearest convenience store. Thank heaven, 7-Eleven! I applied a bandage to the wound and the magic of endorphins soon dulled the pain. The worst of it passed in about half an hour, but symptoms lingered for another week 9 . View Image Details Traditional Taiwanese puppet show in front of Fushan Temple on Highway 139. View Image Details Divination by lots: draw a fortune stick, pull the associated scrip from the shelf, and your fate is sealed. Not far from that convenience store I pulled over to scope out a traditional Taiwanese puppet show (bùdàixì 布袋戲). Such shows are a common sight in the countryside, where individual operators are hired to provide entertainment for the gods (as well as any mortals who happen to be in the vicinity). This particular show was directed at Fúshān Temple (福山宮), a modest shrine to the Lords of the Three Mountains (三山國王) here on the very western edge of Nantou City . A little further north on the same road I returned to SunnyHills (微熱山丘), easily the best and most famous pineapple cake brand in Taiwan. Founded in 2008 along this desolate highway, it now draws enormous crowds by offering a free pineapple cake and tea to all visitors. Of course I stopped for a sip and a bite—and a box of these delicious treats! View Image Details The derelict Golden Empire Building looms over Yuanlin, but its mysteries remain hidden inside. Soon thereafter I descended to the lowlands of Changhua, briefly detouring through Yuanlin to check on the status of the Golden Empire Building (黃金帝國大樓), which also suffered substantial damage in the 921 Earthquake. Somehow this derelict commercial complex—almost completely abandoned apart from some ground floor shops and underground parking—remains the tallest building in town. I’ve made several attempts to gain access to the upper levels but never found a way. Sometimes you get lucky, but not this time. View Image Details A broken chimney jutting from a Hoffmann Kiln in rural Huatan. My final photo of the trip was shot while revisiting an abandoned Hoffmann Kiln (八卦窯) along County Highway 137 in Huatan . I suppose this means I completed some sort of brick kiln trifecta, visiting three different kinds of kiln (snake, eye, and Hoffmann) in a single day. Unlike the others, this one does not appear to have affected by the 921 Earthquake. Then again, it is also much more modern than the other two, since it was likely built in the 1960s. Read my full post about this kiln to learn more. Finally I arrived in Changhua City , where I spent six months at the end of 2014 and beginning of 2015. Since this trip was only another half year after departing I had no trouble finding one of my old haunts for a quick dinner. With the evening traffic rush in full swing I crossed into Taichung and completed my journey at the scooter rental shop across from the Japanese colonial era train station. With this formality concluded I caught a train back to Taipei and was home by midnight. In hindsight, it is amazing how much I was able to see and experience in a long weekend of road tripping around Nantou . I really didn’t know too much about Taiwan back then, and couldn’t read much Chinese, but still had a good sense of what might be interesting. Much of what I’ve written about in this series was found by accident, often by looking at places on a map and wondering “what might be here?” Raw curiosity will get you far in this country, especially if you’ve got wheels. Two years later I reprised this trip, setting out from Taichung to return to Puli 10 , but this time I was in no rush to return the scooter, and I ended up driving as far south as Kaohsiung before making my way back over the course of the summer. If you enjoyed this series be sure to dig into my next big project, a record of my Taiwan Summer Road Trip 2017 . There are several ways to translate the various Chinese terms used to describe Indigenous people in Taiwan. While writing about another trip through traditional Bunun lands in an earlier post in this series I did some research and attempted to standardize what terms I use in English: people (族), group (群), and community (部落 or 社區). Incidentally, I avoid the use of the term “aboriginal”, which is discouraged by the Council of Indigenous Peoples , as well as “tribe”, which remains a subject of debate in Taiwanese society. The word “tribe” in English carries certain implications that aren’t always positive nor accurate. This post (in Chinese) makes the case that using the word “tribe” in Taiwan is absurd given that you’ll find Indigenous communities on the MRT line in Taipei, for example. As such, I’ve adopted the term “community” to be more neutral and all-inclusive. ↩ Renlun was formerly known as Rénhé Village (人和村). I am guessing the name was changed to more closely reflect the pronunciation of the village in the local Bunun dialect, which is commonly written Lanlun , Landun , or Lanngdun . Also worth noting: this is almost certainly one of many Bunun groups forcibly resettled in a more accessible locale as part of the Group Relocation Policy (集團移住政策), a direct result of the Truku War of 1914 and, more locally, the Dāndà Incident (丹大事件) of 1917. ↩ Taiwanese bloggers often comment on this bridge. Check out this video tour of the bridge for more. ↩ I wasn’t able to find too much information about this former police substation apart from various news reports from 2015. Assuming the reporting was correct, this substation dates back to approximately 1939, and was in use until 2002, when it was abandoned along with the surrounding dormitories. Since search results trail off after 2015 it is probably safe to assume no action has been taken to begin restoration work. ↩ Checheng has a fascinating history but I’ll save that for another, more in-depth post, as I was only passing through on this particular trip. ↩ According to this post , the monastery and crematorium occupy land originally intended for the construction of a third power generating station related to the Sun Moon Lake Hydroelectric Project ( 日月潭水力電氣工事 ). ↩ I will admit to enjoying the experience of visiting some of Taiwan’s worst tourist traps, but I seldom write about them in any detail. For some insight into this tacky attraction have a look at this post for more photos. ↩ Zhǎngchūn Four-Faced Buddha (長春四面佛) is the original shrine in Taiwan, founded in 1983. Interestingly, it was modeled after the Erawan Shrine in Bangkok , which was only constructed in 1956, for pretty much the same reasons (to bring prosperity to a nearby hotel). I write a little more about this phenomena in a post about the Four-Faced Buddha of Yongkang Street . ↩ More than a week later the wound remained an angry red bullseye the size of my palm, extremely itchy and hot to the touch. ↩ I have been vague about my reasons for visiting Puli three times over the course of the last several years but it shouldn’t be too hard to puzzle out if you’re really curious! ↩

If you’re interested in seeing more of this collapsed temple (and its opulent replacement), follow this link . View Image Details A somewhat less serene shrine to the Four-Faced Buddha next to the Thirteen Eye Kiln in Jiji. While exiting Jiji to the west I swung by the Thirteen Eye Kiln (十三目仔窯). Much like the Shuili Snake Kiln, this one was also destroyed by the 921 Earthquake, but it wasn’t reconstructed. You would be forgiven for assuming, as I did, that the body of the kiln was converted into a bunch of shops selling trinkets and souvenirs, but this is merely a structure inspired by the original kiln, which is little more than a pile of rubble off to one side. The site is quite extensive, however, and you’ll find a wild assortment of quirky shrines and novelty vendors in this tacky tourist trap 7 . I noticed one new feature since my last visit to the site: a shrine to the Four-Faced Buddha (四面佛), better known as Phra Phrom , a Thai incarnation of the Hindu deity Brahma . Such shrines have been sprouting up all over Taiwan in recent years, a consequence of the growing popularity of the original location 8 in Taipei . View Image Details A pair of tanks on display next to Longquan Station and the eastern terminus of the Jiji Green Tunnel. Left: M18; right: M24. View Image Details A much clearer iteration of the KMT emblem on the M18 tank. Next to Lóngquán Station (龍泉車站) and the eastern terminus of the Jiji Green Tunnel (集集綠色隧道) one will find a pair of tanks on display. The one on the left is an M18 Hellcat , manufactured for action in World War 2 and discontinued in 1944. Several hundred M18s were sold to the Republic of China in 1952, part of the first round of American military aid given to the KMT after their retreat to Taiwan. The tank on the right is an M24 Chaffee , another WW2-era design, although there is some chance it could be a variant known as the M24A1, which was in service in Taiwan until the late 1990s. The proximity to an enormous military base in the mountains behind the railway station is probably no accident. View Image Details This leaning power pole is a memorial to the devastating 921 Earthquake of 1999. View Image Details A quirky sign for Tea Fingers Story House ( 茶二指故事館 ), a roadside attraction on Highway 139. Darkness gathered as I rode through the camphor trees lining County Road 152. Soon I passed into Mingjian and the Nantou 921 Earthquake Leaning Tower Memorial Site (南投九二一地震斜塔紀念地), visible from Provincial Highway 16 if you know where to look. If I’m not mistaken, this transmission tower was knocked to one side by soil liquefaction . There is a small park surrounding the remains of the tower but I didn’t stop long enough for a closer look on this trip. Dusk was settling over the countryside and I still had a lot of driving to do. View Image Details Out in the tea fields of Mingjian, not far from where I was stung by a bee (or whatever). Rather than descend to the rural-industrial sprawl of the Changhua Plain (彰化平原) I opted to head for County Highway 139, which runs the length of Bāguàshān (八卦山), a rocky ridge-line that forms much of the border between Nantou and Changhua. Here, while riding through the hazy tea fields, I experienced a novel physical sensation: a sudden, sharp pain on my exposed leg that might have been a bee sting. I reached down and dislodged a small, black object, initially assuming this to be a piece of glass or grit, but perhaps it was a stinger. Within moments I was overcome by excruciating pain and had to pull over to make a contingency plan. I’ve never been stung but several of my relatives are extremely allergic to bees—and here I was in some unremarkable expanse of countryside, with no help in sight. Several anxious moments followed as I continued north, climbed into the hills, and made it to the nearest convenience store. Thank heaven, 7-Eleven! I applied a bandage to the wound and the magic of endorphins soon dulled the pain. The worst of it passed in about half an hour, but symptoms lingered for another week 9 . View Image Details Traditional Taiwanese puppet show in front of Fushan Temple on Highway 139. View Image Details Divination by lots: draw a fortune stick, pull the associated scrip from the shelf, and your fate is sealed. Not far from that convenience store I pulled over to scope out a traditional Taiwanese puppet show (bùdàixì 布袋戲). Such shows are a common sight in the countryside, where individual operators are hired to provide entertainment for the gods (as well as any mortals who happen to be in the vicinity). This particular show was directed at Fúshān Temple (福山宮), a modest shrine to the Lords of the Three Mountains (三山國王) here on the very western edge of Nantou City . A little further north on the same road I returned to SunnyHills (微熱山丘), easily the best and most famous pineapple cake brand in Taiwan. Founded in 2008 along this desolate highway, it now draws enormous crowds by offering a free pineapple cake and tea to all visitors. Of course I stopped for a sip and a bite—and a box of these delicious treats! View Image Details The derelict Golden Empire Building looms over Yuanlin, but its mysteries remain hidden inside. Soon thereafter I descended to the lowlands of Changhua, briefly detouring through Yuanlin to check on the status of the Golden Empire Building (黃金帝國大樓), which also suffered substantial damage in the 921 Earthquake. Somehow this derelict commercial complex—almost completely abandoned apart from some ground floor shops and underground parking—remains the tallest building in town. I’ve made several attempts to gain access to the upper levels but never found a way. Sometimes you get lucky, but not this time. View Image Details A broken chimney jutting from a Hoffmann Kiln in rural Huatan. My final photo of the trip was shot while revisiting an abandoned Hoffmann Kiln (八卦窯) along County Highway 137 in Huatan . I suppose this means I completed some sort of brick kiln trifecta, visiting three different kinds of kiln (snake, eye, and Hoffmann) in a single day. Unlike the others, this one does not appear to have affected by the 921 Earthquake. Then again, it is also much more modern than the other two, since it was likely built in the 1960s. Read my full post about this kiln to learn more. Finally I arrived in Changhua City , where I spent six months at the end of 2014 and beginning of 2015. Since this trip was only another half year after departing I had no trouble finding one of my old haunts for a quick dinner. With the evening traffic rush in full swing I crossed into Taichung and completed my journey at the scooter rental shop across from the Japanese colonial era train station. With this formality concluded I caught a train back to Taipei and was home by midnight. In hindsight, it is amazing how much I was able to see and experience in a long weekend of road tripping around Nantou . I really didn’t know too much about Taiwan back then, and couldn’t read much Chinese, but still had a good sense of what might be interesting. Much of what I’ve written about in this series was found by accident, often by looking at places on a map and wondering “what might be here?” Raw curiosity will get you far in this country, especially if you’ve got wheels. Two years later I reprised this trip, setting out from Taichung to return to Puli 10 , but this time I was in no rush to return the scooter, and I ended up driving as far south as Kaohsiung before making my way back over the course of the summer. If you enjoyed this series be sure to dig into my next big project, a record of my Taiwan Summer Road Trip 2017 . There are several ways to translate the various Chinese terms used to describe Indigenous people in Taiwan. While writing about another trip through traditional Bunun lands in an earlier post in this series I did some research and attempted to standardize what terms I use in English: people (族), group (群), and community (部落 or 社區). Incidentally, I avoid the use of the term “aboriginal”, which is discouraged by the Council of Indigenous Peoples , as well as “tribe”, which remains a subject of debate in Taiwanese society. The word “tribe” in English carries certain implications that aren’t always positive nor accurate. This post (in Chinese) makes the case that using the word “tribe” in Taiwan is absurd given that you’ll find Indigenous communities on the MRT line in Taipei, for example. As such, I’ve adopted the term “community” to be more neutral and all-inclusive. ↩ Renlun was formerly known as Rénhé Village (人和村). I am guessing the name was changed to more closely reflect the pronunciation of the village in the local Bunun dialect, which is commonly written Lanlun , Landun , or Lanngdun . Also worth noting: this is almost certainly one of many Bunun groups forcibly resettled in a more accessible locale as part of the Group Relocation Policy (集團移住政策), a direct result of the Truku War of 1914 and, more locally, the Dāndà Incident (丹大事件) of 1917. ↩ Taiwanese bloggers often comment on this bridge. Check out this video tour of the bridge for more. ↩ I wasn’t able to find too much information about this former police substation apart from various news reports from 2015. Assuming the reporting was correct, this substation dates back to approximately 1939, and was in use until 2002, when it was abandoned along with the surrounding dormitories. Since search results trail off after 2015 it is probably safe to assume no action has been taken to begin restoration work. ↩ Checheng has a fascinating history but I’ll save that for another, more in-depth post, as I was only passing through on this particular trip. ↩ According to this post , the monastery and crematorium occupy land originally intended for the construction of a third power generating station related to the Sun Moon Lake Hydroelectric Project ( 日月潭水力電氣工事 ). ↩ I will admit to enjoying the experience of visiting some of Taiwan’s worst tourist traps, but I seldom write about them in any detail. For some insight into this tacky attraction have a look at this post for more photos. ↩ Zhǎngchūn Four-Faced Buddha (長春四面佛) is the original shrine in Taiwan, founded in 1983. Interestingly, it was modeled after the Erawan Shrine in Bangkok , which was only constructed in 1956, for pretty much the same reasons (to bring prosperity to a nearby hotel). I write a little more about this phenomena in a post about the Four-Faced Buddha of Yongkang Street . ↩ More than a week later the wound remained an angry red bullseye the size of my palm, extremely itchy and hot to the touch. ↩ I have been vague about my reasons for visiting Puli three times over the course of the last several years but it shouldn’t be too hard to puzzle out if you’re really curious! ↩

Wǔchāng Temple 武昌宮 is one of many remnants of the devastating 921 Earthquake , which ripped through central Taiwan on September 21st, 1999, toppling tens of thousands of buildings and claiming nearly 2,500 lives. Located in the rural township of Jiji in Nantou , less than five kilometers from the epicenter of the magnitude 7 quake , this temple was destroyed mere months after it was completed. Rather than clear the debris, the damaged structure was left more or less as it was the morning after it collapsed, and a new temple with the same name was built in front. Nowadays this ruined temple is a popular roadside attraction and a prime example of disaster tourism in Taiwan . View Image Details The ruins of the collapsed Wuchang Temple in January 2014. The history of this particular temple stretches back to 1923 but the land it now occupies was not donated until 1990. Construction began shortly thereafter and the temple was consecrated and opened to the public in early 1999. The primary god venerated here is the immortal Xuán Wǔ 玄武 (literally “dark warrior”), a deity previously described in my post about Héngwén Temple 衡文宮 in nearby Yuanlin . He is commonly depicted subduing a pair of monsters, a turtle and a snake collectively known as the Black Tortoise in English. On my first visit to the site there was a statue of Xuan Wu and a wishing well 1 in front of the ruined temple; look closely at the god’s feet and you’ll see the snake and turtle. View Image Details View Image Details View Image Details View Image Details View Image Details Since the earthquake struck in the dead of night nobody was harmed in the collapse of the temple—but several gods were trapped inside the main hall. After the collapse a search party was organized to enter the ruins—and the idols were “rescued” and relocated to a temporary structure to await the construction of a new, hopefully more permanent dwelling place. The idols enshrined in Taiwanese temples are physical manifestations of specific deities, portals through which a god perceives the mortal realm, but they also possess individual qualities and lead lives of their own. These statues aren’t mere hunks of wood and metal—they regularly visit their friends in other temples, watch puppet shows and other more lascivious forms of entertainment, and receive offerings suited to their divine needs and origin stories. And in this instance, three of the most important idols rescued from the ruins of Wuchang Temple subsequently underwent a transformation: their beards grew with each passing year, evidently animated by surviving the disaster. Word spread after this “miracle” was observed and people came from all over Taiwan to pray and donate to the reconstruction project. View Image Details The baleful gaze of the dark and mysterious warrior, Xuán Wǔ 玄武 . View Image Details View Image Details View Image Details View Image Details The newly-opened Wuchang Temple. Wuchang Temple underwent a dramatic reversal of fortunes in the years after the quake. With donations pouring in, an opulent new temple was erected next to the ruins of the old. I visited the temple twice in 2014, not long after it opened to the public 2 , and was amused by the carnival atmosphere. LED lights were haphazardly draped across the ruins, presumably to illuminate them after dark, and a huge blow-up rubber duck was installed in the parking lot. As if a collapsed temple wasn’t enough of a draw—they had to jump on the duck mania bandwagon as well 3 . View Image Details A closer look at the exterior of the new temple. It is obviously more elegant and refined than the original. View Image Details One of the halls on the side has a small shrine to the god of wealth. On the left side of the main hall a small shrine to Cái Shén 財神 , the God of Wealth, caught my eye. Stepping inside, you’ll find a large golden sycee (Mandarin Chinese: yuánbǎo 元寶), a traditional Chinese ingot. While making a donation, supplicants rub the top of the ingot, which explains its polished appearance. Whether anyone got rich by praying here is unknown to me—but the temple certainly seems to be doing pretty well. View Image Details Returning to the ruins of Wuchang Temple in late 2015. View Image Details The wishing well and other objects were removed, and a new banner reads Jiji 921 Earthquake Memorial 集集九二一地震紀念館 . No visit to the quaint tourist town of Jiji is complete without at least a quick stop at Wuchang Temple. It is prominently marked on Google Maps so you should have no trouble finding it. Apart from the collapsed school on the site of the 921 Earthquake Museum this is probably the most dramatic reminder of a disaster that completely reshaped Taiwan. Note: this post was previously published in 2014 but completely rewritten in 2019. It wasn’t immediately obvious what this was until I translated the Chinese (xǔyuànchí 許願池). Somewhat confusingly, this is also the name of the Fontana di Trevi in Rome. On subsequent visits this structure was relocated or removed—I’m not entirely sure where it ended up. ↩ If you’re curious about what this temple looked like prior to completion, this post documents the situation in Chinese (with numerous photos, including several showing how much the beards of the gods have grown over the years). This post also features some photos from around the same time. For more great coverage of this ruin (in English this time), check out this post from Josh Ellis. ↩ This was an ode to Rubber Duck , a public art installation by Florentijn Hofman, which arrived in Taiwan in late 2013. This set off a frenzy of interest that only began to wane by late 2014. ↩

My second day of riding Huādōng Valley (花東縱谷) in 2018 was not everything I hoped it would be. I didn’t manage a proper night’s rest due to a malfunctioning air condition and woke up feeling weak and dehydrated. With temperatures hitting 35°C on the road, and with fewer convenience store stops along the way, it turned out to be the most difficult day of riding on this particular trip back in May 2018. I originally planned to detour into the mountains to visit the village of Tóngmén (銅門) and cruise around Carp Lake (鯉魚潭) on my way south. Instead I elected to head straight down Provincial Highway 9 through Ji'an and Shoufeng into Fenglin to make up for lost time. Although I didn’t see nearly as much as planned I am glad to have an excuse to return to this part of Taiwan . View Image Details Riding south through the rural roads of Ji’an District with clouds lingering over the foothills of the Central Mountain Range. View Image Details Taiwanese roadwork dummies , mandated by law to be displayed at construction sites across the nation. View Image Details Traditional memorial markers announce a Christian funeral in rural Ji’an, not an uncommon sight in the super-aged countryside. View Image Details Riding through the taro fields of Ji’an. View Image Details An old tobacco barn near the entrance to Nanhua Village. The first notable stop of the day was in Nánhuá Village (南華村), formerly the Japanese immigrant village of Hatsune (初音). The fertile plains surrounding Hualien City became the testbed for Japanese settler colonialism in Taiwan, a system that eventually spread throughout the Huadong Valley and, in a limited fashion, to certain parts of western Taiwan 1 . Colonial authorities undertook a pilot project in the area from 1909 to 1918, providing various incentives and subsidies to attract mostly poor Japanese migrants, who then developed the rural wilderness into productive farmland, often by growing sugarcane or tobacco. As planned communities, these immigrant villages typically featured schoolhouses, medical clinics, Shinto shrines, and other civic buildings. After World War 2 the vast majority of Japanese in Taiwan were repatriated—including ethnic Japanese born in Taiwan who had never even set foot in their ancestral homeland. These people became known as the wansei (灣生, which literally means “Taiwan-born”) in Japanese society, and their fascinating and often tragic stories have recently become the subject of documentaries and feature articles . Not all wansei came from the immigrant villages—but immigrant villages like Hatsune, exclusive enclaves of ethnic Japanese, were completely depopulated. A few short years later nearly two million Chinese Nationalist soldiers and their families crossed the Taiwan Strait, fleeing the advance of the People’s Liberation Army . This mass influx of people precipitated a housing crisis—which led to the integration of many newly abandoned Japanese homes into the burgeoning system of KMT military dependents’ villages. Many former immigrant villages (including Hatsune) were renamed to reflect Chinese Nationalist ideology, their Shinto shrines neglected and eventually dismantled, but just about everything else was put to use by the new residents from China. In many cases, KMT soldiers and their families picked up where their predecessors had left off, farming tobacco and other cash crops. In half a decade one people completely replaced another. View Image Details Zhōng Family Tobacco Barn can be found on the north side of Nanhua Village. View Image Details This particular tobacco barn has a sunken furnace, a feature I haven’t noticed elsewhere. Few traces of the original Japanese settlement remain, but a closer examination reveals a pair of tobacco barns, residual artifacts of economic activity stretching back to the colonial era. Tobacco barns were used to cure tobacco leaves before bringing them to market, a process described in greater detail in my post about the Shuinan Tobacco Barn in Taichung . The larger, more modern-looking tobacco barn near the highway does not appear to have a name, but the one near the back of the village is known as the Zhōng Family Tobacco Barn (鍾家菸樓), and probably dates to the mid-1950s 2 . The sunken furnace is a somewhat unusual design I haven’t noticed elsewhere, and some effort has been taken to turn it into a small museum with archival photos posted on one wall. View Image Details The derelict Gancheng Station, abandoned since 1994. Moving on, I made a brief stop at Gānchéng Station ( 干城車站 ), the first of several abandoned railway stations I visited on this trip. The Taitung Line links Hualien City and Taitung City along the length of the long, narrow Huadong Valley, which is approximately 160 kilometers in length but seldom more than 5 kilometers wide. The Japanese completed this railway line in 1926 after running tracks south from Hualien City and north from Taitung City, meeting in Yuli . This particular station entered into service in 1916 to meet the needs of the nearby immigrant village, after which it was originally named. It was rebuilt sometime during the KMT authoritarian era , probably in the early 1980s, and underwent several name changes before it was finally abolished in 1994 3 . View Image Details Crossing the railway line somewhere in Shoufeng Township. View Image Details The former Shinto shrine in Shoufeng is now a small park honoring Sun Yat-Sen. View Image Details KMT iconography now occupies the site of the original Shinto shrine built here in Japanese colonial times. View Image Details Sun Yat-Sen with a copy of the Three Principles of the People in his hand. Heading south into Shoufeng I cycled over to the mountainside to visit the local iteration of Zhongshan Park (中山公園), formerly the Shoufeng Shinto Shrine ( 壽社 ). The stairway is the original sandō (參道, visiting path), but the torii (鳥居) is long gone, likely removed in the mid-1970s, when a wave of anti-Japanese sentiment swept the nation 4 . This particular shrine was replaced by a statue of Sun Yat-sen holding a copy of the Three Principles of the People (三民主義). The dilapidated state of this monument is a reflection how many Taiwanese feel about these antiquated KMT relics nowadays. View Image Details My ride with the Coastal Mountain Range in the background. That’s all I carry when I’m bike touring. View Image Details An amazing cistern somewhere on the outskirts of Fengtian. Further south I entered Fēngtián (豐田, literally “abundant rice paddy”), another settlement that began as a Japanese immigrant village, then known as then known as Toyota. Founded in 1913, it was among the first in Hualien, and apparently served as model settlement for the colonial authorities. Whereas Nanhua was associated with tobacco cultivation, Fengtian (and most immigrant villages deeper into the valley) specialized in sugarcane, which would have been destined for a huge processing plant in Guangfu . There are few signs of colonial history in the immediate vicinity of the train station but there are plenty more in the countryside, as we will see. But first, let’s take a closer look at the derelict movie theater on the main street in front of the station, one of my primary targets for the day. View Image Details The former Datong Theater in Fengtian. View Image Details A closer look at the fading signage for Datong Theater. View Image Details Definitely not the most aesthetically-pleasing theater facade in Taiwan. Dàtóng Theater (大同戲院) was built sometime in the mid-1960s and was the only theater in Fengtian 5 . Apart from showing films it also hosted community events, a common auxiliary function in rural areas. Small town cinemas often serve as socioeconomic indicators—study their histories and there is a good chance you’ll uncover something interesting about the rise and fall of local industries. In the case of Datong Theater, it was probably built after the beginning of the Fengtian jade rush in 1965 6 , and went out of business sometime after the industry collapsed in 1981. Since then it was used as storage, and from what I’ve read the original projectors remain somewhere inside the building. There was no obvious means of entry nor anyone around to answer questions or provide a tour when I visited so the interior will remain a mystery for now. View Image Details An old house on the main street running through the former Fengtian Immigrant Village. It is difficult to know for sure but this is likely an early post-war structure. View Image Details An old wooden church in Fengtian. It looks like a repurposed Japanese building but apparently it was constructed anew from material salvaged on site from older buildings. View Image Details The ugly remains of a window on the side of the old wooden church. View Image Details A quick glimpse inside the abandoned church. Head southeast of Fengtian station and you’ll reach what is now known as Fēnglǐ Village (豐裡村), originally the heart of the Fengtian Immigrant Village (豐田移民村). The settlement is laid out in a grid and features many colonial buildings in various states of repair: police station, doctor’s clinic, elementary school, and so on 7 . An abandoned wooden building caught my eye and I wandered over to take a look. Surprisingly, it was a church! Known as St. Joseph’s Cathedral (聖若瑟天主堂), and later the Yùdé Nursery (育德托兒所), it was constructed after the war from material scavenged around the village. The original Japanese inhabitants of this village would not have been Christian! View Image Details The newly refurbished torii in the heart of the Fengtian Immigrant Village. The shrine itself was another 600 meters down this street. View Image Details Old stone lanterns at the site of the former Shinto shrine. View Image Details A new stone komainu (lion-dog), recently installed. The Japanese often placed Shinto shrines on auspicious hillsides in Taiwan—but Fengli Village is situated on the flat alluvial plains in the very middle of the valley, so its shrine was originally located in a forested grove approximately 600 meters from the main settlement. Founded in 1915, Fengtian Shinto Shrine ( 豐田神社 ) was allegedly destroyed by Typhoon Winnie (颱風溫妮) in 1958, and replaced by Bìlián Temple (碧蓮寺) a few years later. The original stone lanterns and a pair of komainu (狛犬, guardian lion-dogs) were retained, and some of these artifacts can still be seen at the temple. Apparently the komainu were stolen at some point, but replacements were fashioned and installed next to the torii that marks the start of the visiting path 8 . View Image Details A bizarre country home straight out of McMansion Hell . After rambling around the backroads around the former shrine I merged with Highway 9 and crossed the dry and dusty Shoufeng River ( 壽豐溪 ) by way of the New Fēngpíng Bridge (新豐平大橋). This bridge, with a span of 906 meters, was only completed in 2012, shaving a few minutes off the detour west to the original Fēngpíng Bridge (豐平橋). Touching down on the south bank of the river I entered Fenglin with only a few more items to cross off my list before calling it a day. View Image Details An abandoned betel nut booth on the way into Fenglin Township. Fenglin is a rural township at the geographic center of Hualien with slightly more than 10,000 residents. It is a Hakka majority town, although there are also a great many Amis people living here. A Japanese immigrant village was also constructed in Fenglin, but it is somewhat out of scope for this post, as I did not see it on this trip 9 . Many Hakka migrated to Fenglin in the Japanese colonial era, particularly from Hsinchu and Miaoli . Unlike Fengtian, this township does not seem to have undergone a period of explosive growth or sudden collapse, although I’m quite sure the shifting fortunes of the forestry sector had an impact on the local economy 10 . Tobacco was a major cash crop for much of the 20th century, but Fenglin farmers have diversified in recent decades, and tourism is on the rise.

Ultimately I didn’t manage to visit everything I hoped to see on my second day of riding down the Huadong Valley, but at least I made it without dying of exposure. Heatstroke is a nasty thing, and I spent several agonizing hours in bed before I finally got to sleep. I don’t normally recommend hotels in my bicycle touring posts, but in this case I’d like to mention Fong Wu Hotel (鳳悟旅社), affordable vintage lodging near the train station. The price is right (around 700 NT per night) and the facilities are sufficient for cyclists in need of a good night’s rest. Coming up next: the ride through Guangfu and Ruisui to Yuli.

Most of the larger Shinto sites ended up as Martyrs’ Shrines (see my first post in this series for an example), while those smaller shrines that weren’t demolished outright were often converted into monuments to various aspects of KMT party ideology or regular Taiwanese temples.

Trade goods sourced from these same deposits can be found all over Southeastern Asia, and a major prehistoric jade workshop, the Pínglín Site (平林遺址), was located near Xīlín Village (西林村) in neighbouring Wanrong. This knowledge was lost over time, and it wasn’t until the Japanese arrived on the scene in the 1930s that miners returned to these mountains . But the Japanese weren’t interested in jade, particularly when the war effort really got going—they came to exploit asbestos , which commonly appears alongside nephrite jade . Industrial-scale mining began in 1937 and any jade mined while extracting asbestos was discarded into a nearby river, Báibào Creek (白鮑溪). After the war the ROC continued mining in the area, extracting asbestos, talc, and other minerals, while continuing to ignore any jade they encountered. It wasn’t until the early 1960s that geologists realized the mining waste contained valuable jade—and when the Central Daily News ( 中央日報 ) ran a story in 1965 it transformed sleepy Fengtian into a mining boomtown almost overnight. Thousands of people flooded into Fengtian to seek their fortune, and Taiwan would go on to supply more than half of the world’s nephrite jade in the 1970s. The industry reached its peak in 1976, but it was only a few short years later that mining all but ceased as the cost of mining and processing grew and global demand sharply declined. Nowadays the vast majority of the mines are abandoned even though plenty of jade remains.

My second day of riding Huādōng Valley (花東縱谷) in 2018 was not everything I hoped it would be. I didn’t manage a proper night’s rest due to a malfunctioning air condition and woke up feeling weak and dehydrated. With temperatures hitting 35°C on the road, and with fewer convenience store stops along the way, it turned out to be the most difficult day of riding on this particular trip back in May 2018. I originally planned to detour into the mountains to visit the village of Tóngmén (銅門) and cruise around Carp Lake (鯉魚潭) on my way south. Instead I elected to head straight down Provincial Highway 9 through Ji'an and Shoufeng into Fenglin to make up for lost time. Although I didn’t see nearly as much as planned I am glad to have an excuse to return to this part of Taiwan . View Image Details Riding south through the rural roads of Ji’an District with clouds lingering over the foothills of the Central Mountain Range. View Image Details Taiwanese roadwork dummies , mandated by law to be displayed at construction sites across the nation. View Image Details Traditional memorial markers announce a Christian funeral in rural Ji’an, not an uncommon sight in the super-aged countryside. View Image Details Riding through the taro fields of Ji’an. View Image Details An old tobacco barn near the entrance to Nanhua Village. The first notable stop of the day was in Nánhuá Village (南華村), formerly the Japanese immigrant village of Hatsune (初音). The fertile plains surrounding Hualien City became the testbed for Japanese settler colonialism in Taiwan, a system that eventually spread throughout the Huadong Valley and, in a limited fashion, to certain parts of western Taiwan 1 . Colonial authorities undertook a pilot project in the area from 1909 to 1918, providing various incentives and subsidies to attract mostly poor Japanese migrants, who then developed the rural wilderness into productive farmland, often by growing sugarcane or tobacco. As planned communities, these immigrant villages typically featured schoolhouses, medical clinics, Shinto shrines, and other civic buildings. After World War 2 the vast majority of Japanese in Taiwan were repatriated—including ethnic Japanese born in Taiwan who had never even set foot in their ancestral homeland. These people became known as the wansei (灣生, which literally means “Taiwan-born”) in Japanese society, and their fascinating and often tragic stories have recently become the subject of documentaries and feature articles . Not all wansei came from the immigrant villages—but immigrant villages like Hatsune, exclusive enclaves of ethnic Japanese, were completely depopulated. A few short years later nearly two million Chinese Nationalist soldiers and their families crossed the Taiwan Strait, fleeing the advance of the People’s Liberation Army . This mass influx of people precipitated a housing crisis—which led to the integration of many newly abandoned Japanese homes into the burgeoning system of KMT military dependents’ villages. Many former immigrant villages (including Hatsune) were renamed to reflect Chinese Nationalist ideology, their Shinto shrines neglected and eventually dismantled, but just about everything else was put to use by the new residents from China. In many cases, KMT soldiers and their families picked up where their predecessors had left off, farming tobacco and other cash crops. In half a decade one people completely replaced another. View Image Details Zhōng Family Tobacco Barn can be found on the north side of Nanhua Village. View Image Details This particular tobacco barn has a sunken furnace, a feature I haven’t noticed elsewhere. Few traces of the original Japanese settlement remain, but a closer examination reveals a pair of tobacco barns, residual artifacts of economic activity stretching back to the colonial era. Tobacco barns were used to cure tobacco leaves before bringing them to market, a process described in greater detail in my post about the Shuinan Tobacco Barn in Taichung . The larger, more modern-looking tobacco barn near the highway does not appear to have a name, but the one near the back of the village is known as the Zhōng Family Tobacco Barn (鍾家菸樓), and probably dates to the mid-1950s 2 . The sunken furnace is a somewhat unusual design I haven’t noticed elsewhere, and some effort has been taken to turn it into a small museum with archival photos posted on one wall. View Image Details The derelict Gancheng Station, abandoned since 1994. Moving on, I made a brief stop at Gānchéng Station ( 干城車站 ), the first of several abandoned railway stations I visited on this trip. The Taitung Line links Hualien City and Taitung City along the length of the long, narrow Huadong Valley, which is approximately 160 kilometers in length but seldom more than 5 kilometers wide. The Japanese completed this railway line in 1926 after running tracks south from Hualien City and north from Taitung City, meeting in Yuli . This particular station entered into service in 1916 to meet the needs of the nearby immigrant village, after which it was originally named. It was rebuilt sometime during the KMT authoritarian era , probably in the early 1980s, and underwent several name changes before it was finally abolished in 1994 3 .

View Image Details KMT iconography now occupies the site of the original Shinto shrine built here in Japanese colonial times. View Image Details Sun Yat-Sen with a copy of the Three Principles of the People in his hand. Heading south into Shoufeng I cycled over to the mountainside to visit the local iteration of Zhongshan Park (中山公園), formerly the Shoufeng Shinto Shrine ( 壽社 ). The stairway is the original sandō (參道, visiting path), but the torii (鳥居) is long gone, likely removed in the mid-1970s, when a wave of anti-Japanese sentiment swept the nation 4 . This particular shrine was replaced by a statue of Sun Yat-sen holding a copy of the Three Principles of the People (三民主義). The dilapidated state of this monument is a reflection how many Taiwanese feel about these antiquated KMT relics nowadays. View Image Details My ride with the Coastal Mountain Range in the background. That’s all I carry when I’m bike touring. View Image Details An amazing cistern somewhere on the outskirts of Fengtian. Further south I entered Fēngtián (豐田, literally “abundant rice paddy”), another settlement that began as a Japanese immigrant village, then known as then known as Toyota. Founded in 1913, it was among the first in Hualien, and apparently served as model settlement for the colonial authorities. Whereas Nanhua was associated with tobacco cultivation, Fengtian (and most immigrant villages deeper into the valley) specialized in sugarcane, which would have been destined for a huge processing plant in Guangfu . There are few signs of colonial history in the immediate vicinity of the train station but there are plenty more in the countryside, as we will see. But first, let’s take a closer look at the derelict movie theater on the main street in front of the station, one of my primary targets for the day. View Image Details The former Datong Theater in Fengtian. View Image Details A closer look at the fading signage for Datong Theater. View Image Details Definitely not the most aesthetically-pleasing theater facade in Taiwan. Dàtóng Theater (大同戲院) was built sometime in the mid-1960s and was the only theater in Fengtian 5 . Apart from showing films it also hosted community events, a common auxiliary function in rural areas. Small town cinemas often serve as socioeconomic indicators—study their histories and there is a good chance you’ll uncover something interesting about the rise and fall of local industries. In the case of Datong Theater, it was probably built after the beginning of the Fengtian jade rush in 1965 6 , and went out of business sometime after the industry collapsed in 1981. Since then it was used as storage, and from what I’ve read the original projectors remain somewhere inside the building. There was no obvious means of entry nor anyone around to answer questions or provide a tour when I visited so the interior will remain a mystery for now. View Image Details An old house on the main street running through the former Fengtian Immigrant Village. It is difficult to know for sure but this is likely an early post-war structure. View Image Details An old wooden church in Fengtian. It looks like a repurposed Japanese building but apparently it was constructed anew from material salvaged on site from older buildings. View Image Details The ugly remains of a window on the side of the old wooden church. View Image Details A quick glimpse inside the abandoned church. Head southeast of Fengtian station and you’ll reach what is now known as Fēnglǐ Village (豐裡村), originally the heart of the Fengtian Immigrant Village (豐田移民村). The settlement is laid out in a grid and features many colonial buildings in various states of repair: police station, doctor’s clinic, elementary school, and so on 7 . An abandoned wooden building caught my eye and I wandered over to take a look. Surprisingly, it was a church! Known as St. Joseph’s Cathedral (聖若瑟天主堂), and later the Yùdé Nursery (育德托兒所), it was constructed after the war from material scavenged around the village. The original Japanese inhabitants of this village would not have been Christian! View Image Details The newly refurbished torii in the heart of the Fengtian Immigrant Village. The shrine itself was another 600 meters down this street. View Image Details Old stone lanterns at the site of the former Shinto shrine. View Image Details A new stone komainu (lion-dog), recently installed. The Japanese often placed Shinto shrines on auspicious hillsides in Taiwan—but Fengli Village is situated on the flat alluvial plains in the very middle of the valley, so its shrine was originally located in a forested grove approximately 600 meters from the main settlement. Founded in 1915, Fengtian Shinto Shrine ( 豐田神社 ) was allegedly destroyed by Typhoon Winnie (颱風溫妮) in 1958, and replaced by Bìlián Temple (碧蓮寺) a few years later. The original stone lanterns and a pair of komainu (狛犬, guardian lion-dogs) were retained, and some of these artifacts can still be seen at the temple. Apparently the komainu were stolen at some point, but replacements were fashioned and installed next to the torii that marks the start of the visiting path 8 . View Image Details A bizarre country home straight out of McMansion Hell . After rambling around the backroads around the former shrine I merged with Highway 9 and crossed the dry and dusty Shoufeng River ( 壽豐溪 ) by way of the New Fēngpíng Bridge (新豐平大橋). This bridge, with a span of 906 meters, was only completed in 2012, shaving a few minutes off the detour west to the original Fēngpíng Bridge (豐平橋). Touching down on the south bank of the river I entered Fenglin with only a few more items to cross off my list before calling it a day. View Image Details An abandoned betel nut booth on the way into Fenglin Township. Fenglin is a rural township at the geographic center of Hualien with slightly more than 10,000 residents. It is a Hakka majority town, although there are also a great many Amis people living here. A Japanese immigrant village was also constructed in Fenglin, but it is somewhat out of scope for this post, as I did not see it on this trip 9 . Many Hakka migrated to Fenglin in the Japanese colonial era, particularly from Hsinchu and Miaoli . Unlike Fengtian, this township does not seem to have undergone a period of explosive growth or sudden collapse, although I’m quite sure the shifting fortunes of the forestry sector had an impact on the local economy 10 . Tobacco was a major cash crop for much of the 20th century, but Fenglin farmers have diversified in recent decades, and tourism is on the rise. View Image Details The former Taifa Theater, now a warehouse of some kind. Theater hunting in Fenglin was more fruitful than I expected it to be. The most significant cinematic relic remaining in Fenglin is the shell of Tàifā Theater (泰發戲院), now a warehouse of some kind. Taifa is the second theater built on this site; the first, Yuánhé Theater (元和戲院), was constructed in 1959 only to be destroyed in a fire some years later. In a rather shocking twist for such a small town, the owner of the eponymous Fenglin Theater (鳳林戲院), dating back to 1950, was eventually convicted of arson and served time in jail for destroying the competition!

Zhōngyāng Theater (中央戲院) is located in Guanmiao , a rural district in southern Tainan home to slightly less than 35,000 residents. The name is derived from a nearby street and simply means Central Theater. It was constructed in 1969, a few short years after an open-air movie theater began showing films on this plot of land just east of the biggest market in town. As with many Taiwanese cinemas of its vintage, it was in business until the late 1980s before winding down, another casualty of changing consumer habits, the collapse of local industry, and rural flight . This year marks the 50th anniversary of Zhongyang Theater, a milestone recently observed by Guanmiao Youth (關廟青), a group of local activists hoping to revitalize their hometown. They were successful in generating some some positive news coverage of the occasion , and now that this theater is in the news, I figure I may as well share my findings from several visits to the site over the last four years. View Image Details My first glimpse of Zhongyang Theater shot back in 2015. View Image Details Full frontal view of the theater in 2018. The small characters flanking what’s left of the name of the theater on either side indicate the date of founding: September 1969. The metal frame in front would have held movie posters, possibly hand-painted ones, back in the day. View Image Details The outer ticket booth visible from the street. View Image Details This case would have once displayed movies now showing ( 近期放映 ). View Image Details A closer look at the ticket booth next to the street. Ticket prices are listed as 60 NT (regular fare) and 50 NT (discount fare, presumably for seniors and veterans). View Image Details Deeper into the murky recesses of the building you’ll find this older ticket booth with a full timetable. The fare schedule also includes a rate for children, something not seen on the other ticket booth. This particular theater occupies the upper levels of a mixed-use building with commercial units on the ground floor, a common design pattern for Taiwanese cinema. The original ticket booth and entrance to the main theater hall was located at the back of the building, drawing patrons down a corridor lined with small shops, another source of income for the owners. As the theater slipped into decline many of those shops closed and several were repurposed as residences, some of which are still occupied today. One unit facing the street was converted into a second ticket booth at some point, another reflection of the theater’s changing fortunes. View Image Details Entering the main hall from the original entrance at the back of the building. Later on patrons would have probably entered from the sides. View Image Details Unlike many theaters of its age, this one was not subdivided into smaller halls. View Image Details The silver screen draped across a broken speaker on stage. Theater owners resorted to a variety of measures to remain in business throughout the twilight of the Taiwanese cinema industry. One common practice involved subdividing large halls into smaller rooms to show more films, but this wasn’t attempted here. Zhongyang remains one of a select few theaters that remained more or less the same as when it opened: one vast hall, with numbered seating for approximately 300 patrons. Apart from showing films, this theater also hosted graduation ceremonies and other local events, as can be seen in this article (and the accompanying video ). Decades after closure the rooftop is collapsing in several areas, wooden seating is decaying into mulch, and every surface is coated in grey dust, but it remains easy to appreciate the scale of this old theater. View Image Details Inside the projection booth. The expensive lenses and bulbs have been removed from the projectors themselves, leaving only hollow shells. View Image Details Another look at one of the projectors left in Zhongyang Theater. Note the ventilation shaft protruding from the top of the projector, which leads to the rooftop; these machines emitted a lot of excess heat while in operation. Beyond demonstrating the aesthetics of decay, old movie theaters, particularly those found in small towns like Guanmiao, also serve as socioeconomic indicators 1 . Guanmiao must have been booming when this place was built—and indeed, Zhongyang Theater was founded not long after the town became a center of the bamboo and rattan industry (竹藤產業) 2 . Factory owners outsourced production to Indonesia in the 1980s and the entire industry collapsed after a rattan export ban was imposed in 1988. By that time plastics had become far more prevalent in Taiwanese society, so Guanmiao began emptying out to bigger urban centers with more employment opportunities for young people, and without a lively customer base, the theater soon went out of business. View Image Details Sunlight seeps in through the broken rooftop, illuminating the lost grandeur of the old theater. View Image Details This way to the concession stand. View Image Details The men’s room and snack bar. There are two cinematic references worth exploring in relation to this movie theater. Faintly visible in one of the photos above is a rusty metal door on the main stage with a small sign posted overhead. This sign reads Dragon Woman Descends ( 龍女下凡 , alternately A Fairy to the World ), a Taiwanese film released in 1982 and presently available for viewing on YouTube . This is likely an artifact of a handmade display initially posted somewhere else since it wouldn’t have been visible to anyone but staff in its present location. View Image Details A stack of sleazy movie posters provide an intriguing mystery. The characters do not match the imagery. View Image Details A wall of intriguing plaques in the grand stairway leading up the back of the building. The second reference is gleaned from a stack of sleazy movie posters found in one of the back rooms. The title listed on the poster is The Red Shoes (紅菱艷), shot in Technicolor (特藝彩色) and starring Anton Walbrook (安東華布克), Moira Shearer (穆拉雪瑞兒), and Marius Goring (瑪琳絲高玲). But there is a problem with this identification: the film is obviously some sort of pornography, and the imagery doesn’t even remotely match that of the Oscar-winning original released in 1948. Showing adult films is a common practice not long before theaters close for good—but what explains the false information on the poster? My guess is that someone copied an existing movie poster to evade the attention of the authorities. View Image Details One last look at Zhongyang Theater from across the street. Finally, several plaques posted in the grand stairway at the very back of the building 3 confirm some of what we’ve already learned, including the date of opening: September 1969 (中華民國五十八年九月). So here we are slightly more than half a century after this theater opened, asking: what will the future hold for Zhongyang Theater? With more than 30 property owners, many of them now residing overseas, it will be difficult to come to any consensus about revitalizing the space, particularly as the population of Guanmiao continues to age and decline. There is a very good chance we are living through the final years before this theater vanishes into history and collective memory. This was not the first or only theater in town; Guanmiao Theater (關廟戲院) predates this one by quite some time, and there was almost certainly a venue for traditional Taiwanese opera, concerts, and other stage performances going back to Japanese colonial times, but I don’t have very much information about any of that. ↩ Bamboo and rattan were processed and used to manufacture furniture, baskets, utensils, and all sorts of household items. This page features a video documenting an old master of the trade along with some archival footage of bamboo and rattan vendors. Guanmiao is also known for pineapple cultivation and the production of the eponymous Guanmiao noodles (many of which are actually manufactured in neighbouring Guiren ) but it sounds like it was bamboo and rattan that brought prosperity to the town around the time this theater was constructed. ↩ In case you’re curious about what some of the others say, I’ve transcribed them here: 國富民樂 (“country becomes rich, people become happier”), 輔佐教育, and 宏圖丕展. ↩

As the theater slipped into decline many of those shops closed and several were repurposed as residences, some of which are still occupied today. One unit facing the street was converted into a second ticket booth at some point, another reflection of the theater’s changing fortunes. View Image Details Entering the main hall from the original entrance at the back of the building. Later on patrons would have probably entered from the sides. View Image Details Unlike many theaters of its age, this one was not subdivided into smaller halls. View Image Details The silver screen draped across a broken speaker on stage. Theater owners resorted to a variety of measures to remain in business throughout the twilight of the Taiwanese cinema industry. One common practice involved subdividing large halls into smaller rooms to show more films, but this wasn’t attempted here. Zhongyang remains one of a select few theaters that remained more or less the same as when it opened: one vast hall, with numbered seating for approximately 300 patrons. Apart from showing films, this theater also hosted graduation ceremonies and other local events, as can be seen in this article (and the accompanying video ). Decades after closure the rooftop is collapsing in several areas, wooden seating is decaying into mulch, and every surface is coated in grey dust, but it remains easy to appreciate the scale of this old theater. View Image Details Inside the projection booth. The expensive lenses and bulbs have been removed from the projectors themselves, leaving only hollow shells. View Image Details Another look at one of the projectors left in Zhongyang Theater. Note the ventilation shaft protruding from the top of the projector, which leads to the rooftop; these machines emitted a lot of excess heat while in operation. Beyond demonstrating the aesthetics of decay, old movie theaters, particularly those found in small towns like Guanmiao, also serve as socioeconomic indicators 1 . Guanmiao must have been booming when this place was built—and indeed, Zhongyang Theater was founded not long after the town became a center of the bamboo and rattan industry (竹藤產業) 2 . Factory owners outsourced production to Indonesia in the 1980s and the entire industry collapsed after a rattan export ban was imposed in 1988. By that time plastics had become far more prevalent in Taiwanese society, so Guanmiao began emptying out to bigger urban centers with more employment opportunities for young people, and without a lively customer base, the theater soon went out of business. View Image Details Sunlight seeps in through the broken rooftop, illuminating the lost grandeur of the old theater. View Image Details This way to the concession stand. View Image Details The men’s room and snack bar. There are two cinematic references worth exploring in relation to this movie theater. Faintly visible in one of the photos above is a rusty metal door on the main stage with a small sign posted overhead. This sign reads Dragon Woman Descends ( 龍女下凡 , alternately A Fairy to the World ), a Taiwanese film released in 1982 and presently available for viewing on YouTube . This is likely an artifact of a handmade display initially posted somewhere else since it wouldn’t have been visible to anyone but staff in its present location. View Image Details A stack of sleazy movie posters provide an intriguing mystery. The characters do not match the imagery. View Image Details A wall of intriguing plaques in the grand stairway leading up the back of the building. The second reference is gleaned from a stack of sleazy movie posters found in one of the back rooms. The title listed on the poster is The Red Shoes (紅菱艷), shot in Technicolor (特藝彩色) and starring Anton Walbrook (安東華布克), Moira Shearer (穆拉雪瑞兒), and Marius Goring (瑪琳絲高玲). But there is a problem with this identification: the film is obviously some sort of pornography, and the imagery doesn’t even remotely match that of the Oscar-winning original released in 1948. Showing adult films is a common practice not long before theaters close for good—but what explains the false information on the poster? My guess is that someone copied an existing movie poster to evade the attention of the authorities. View Image Details One last look at Zhongyang Theater from across the street. Finally, several plaques posted in the grand stairway at the very back of the building 3 confirm some of what we’ve already learned, including the date of opening: September 1969 (中華民國五十八年九月). So here we are slightly more than half a century after this theater opened, asking: what will the future hold for Zhongyang Theater? With more than 30 property owners, many of them now residing overseas, it will be difficult to come to any consensus about revitalizing the space, particularly as the population of Guanmiao continues to age and decline. There is a very good chance we are living through the final years before this theater vanishes into history and collective memory. This was not the first or only theater in town; Guanmiao Theater (關廟戲院) predates this one by quite some time, and there was almost certainly a venue for traditional Taiwanese opera, concerts, and other stage performances going back to Japanese colonial times, but I don’t have very much information about any of that. ↩ Bamboo and rattan were processed and used to manufacture furniture, baskets, utensils, and all sorts of household items. This page features a video documenting an old master of the trade along with some archival footage of bamboo and rattan vendors. Guanmiao is also known for pineapple cultivation and the production of the eponymous Guanmiao noodles (many of which are actually manufactured in neighbouring Guiren ) but it sounds like it was bamboo and rattan that brought prosperity to the town around the time this theater was constructed. ↩ In case you’re curious about what some of the others say, I’ve transcribed them here: 國富民樂 (“country becomes rich, people become happier”), 輔佐教育, and 宏圖丕展. ↩

Taiwan Motor Transport Company 台灣汽車客運公司 (or simply Táiqì 台汽) was a state-owned enterprise founded in 1980, partly to take advantage of the newly-completed National Freeway 1 國道一號 running along the western coast of Taiwan from Keelung to Kaohsiung . Considerable investments were made into an extensive fleet of vehicles, more than two dozen bus stations, and a massive maintenance depot (previously documented on this blog). Despite enjoying a monopoly on long distance, intercity coach travel, the company struggled to remain profitable in its first decade of operations—and when the market was deregulated and opened to competition in the early 1990s, its fate was sealed. After incurring another decade of losses Taiqi was privatized in 2001 under the name Kuo-Kuang Motor Transport Company 國光汽車客運股份有限公司 , which continues to operate today, albeit on a much smaller scale. One consequence of the downsizing that preceded privatization was the closure of the Changhua Bus Terminal in Changhua City , the administrative capital of Changhua .

Sānqīng Sānyuán Temple 三清三元宮 is an unusual attraction in Fuxing, immediately to the south of Lukang in Changhua , Taiwan . It was constructed over the course of nearly two decades by Huang Chi-Chun 黃奇春, a former soldier who moved here in the late 1970s. This otherwise modest structure is adorned with thousands of seashells, pieces of coral, and other oceanic oddments—which is why it is more commonly known as the Changhua Shell Temple 彰化貝殼廟. View Image Details Immediately outside Sanqing Sanyuan Temple. The entrance is obscured behind some plants; there is a cemetery to the right. View Image Details Octagonal gateway to the temple forecourt. View Image Details Twisted statues line the inner walls of the shell temple. View Image Details The idiosyncratic shell temple of Changhua, the product of a single man’s vision and determination. What would possess a man to build such a unique 1 and fantastical temple? The explanation is supernatural, of course. Huang’s parcel of land is inauspiciously located next to the historic yet neglected Xiùcuò Cemetery 秀厝公墓 , generally believed to emanate a form of dark energy 2 . Not long after moving here Huang began to experience vivid dreams his friends and family attributed to his proximity to the old cemetery. As he developed the land for aquaculture these dreams became more frequent, and Huang soon interpreted them as directives from from the Three Pure Ones of Taoist lore to construct the temple seen in these photographs. View Image Details An octagonal window on the exterior of the main hall. View Image Details One of several sculptures just outside the main hall. View Image Details A closer look at where a column joins the ceiling. View Image Details Seashells embedded in sandstone. View Image Details Another look at one of the shelled columns. View Image Details The main hall is fairly plain. Idols representing the Three Pure Ones can be seen at the very back, and a sign points the way to the spooky tunnel leading to the rest of the complex. Despite his lack of training in architecture and design Huang applied himself to this divine task, enlisting the help of outsiders only to pour a concrete foundation and erect the bare walls and ceiling of the temple. Apart from some readymade ceramic figurines most of the rest is entirely his work, the product of decades of single-minded dedication and learning on the job. When the temple reached its current state of completion around 1996 the dreams stopped, indicating that Huang had satisfied the will of the gods. The final result makes numerous references to Taoist iconography and myth, from the many representations of the Bāguà 八卦 and Tàijítú 太極圖 symbols, to the Eighteen Arhats 十八羅漢 that line the temple forecourt and Lóngfèng Lane 龍鳳巷, a peculiar tunnel connecting the main hall to a small market area around back.

Dōngxìng Theater (東興大戲院) is located in a small village in the outskirts of Taitung City , Taitung , at the southernmost extent of the Huadong Valley (花東縱谷). Not much is known about its history beyond whatever can be deduced by visiting the site, but it was almost certainly built in the late 1960s, around the same time as Jinxing Theater , located just down the street, and Zhonghua Theater in Guanshan , which has almost the same design. At some point it went out of business, probably in the 1980s, and was converted into a small rural hospital, a repurposing I’ve seen nowhere else in Taiwan . View Image Details The view from the empty lot in front of Dongxing Theater. The ghostly outline of the characters forming the name of this remote theater are faintly visible on the facade—but another set of around a dozen smaller characters on the left are missing and cannot be decoded. Zhonghua Theater also featured a small set of characters to the left of the name—and these allowed me to trace authorship of the calligraphy to an interesting historical figure, a famous KMT assassin who later became a chief of police and politician in Taiwan. Perhaps that same person was also responsible for the brushstrokes on the exterior of this theater, but without access to archival footage we may never know. View Image Details First look inside the old hospital and former theater. Old standalone movie theaters often struggle to find buyers after shutting down. Those that are repurposed are typically transformed into commercial spaces: grocery stores, clothing and electronics shops, pharmacies, and so on. Occasionally I encounter theaters that have undergone novel and surprising conversions—into a recreational shrimp fishing parlour, for example—but never before have I seen one turned into a medical clinic! View Image Details The front desk has not fared well over the years. View Image Details Stalking the corridors of the old hospital. View Image Details A hospital bed shoved into a corner. View Image Details Those black wings are lungs on this old x-ray. View Image Details Dating the abandonment: April 1997. View Image Details Most of the ground floor is completely uninteresting. Everything has been stripped out and only garbage litters the floor. Initially I was reluctant to share information about this theater as it seemed quite obscure and almost untouched—but abandoned hospitals are catnip for YouTubers, and I soon learned this ruin is far from unknown. The clinic was the subject of a popular YouTube video by Xiǎo Yù ( 小玉 ), amassing more than a million views in the three years since it was published. Since that video went viral several more YouTubers visited the site to produce their own content (including a two-part video shot at night, found here and here ), all of which are readily found if you know what terms to search for in Chinese 1 . Somewhat surprisingly, the videos I perused focused exclusively on the bland ruins of the hospital on the ground floor, completely ignoring the secrets of the second level. View Image Details Overlooking the abandoned hospital inside the body of the theater. A false ceiling maintained the illusion of a more confined space. The silver screen would have been against the opposite wall in this picture. A more thorough inspection of the lobby of the clinic will reveal a narrow stairway leading up to the original projection room, which lay almost untouched since the closure of the theater. If this theater suffered a similar fate to that of its peers in Taitung it probably went out of business in the early 1980s, around when the local economic boom began to dissipate. A calendar on the ground floor provides a likely date of abandonment for the hospital: April 1997. From this we can estimate the clinic was in operation for ten to fifteen years. I wonder how many doctors, nurses, and patients knew of the twin projectors staring into the darkness above the false ceiling of the clinic all that time? View Image Details The original carbon arc lamp projectors stare blankly into the empty space above the abandoned hospital, dead eyes gazing into the darkness. The carbon arc lamp projectors are standard issue for a Taiwanese theater of this vintage. Both projectors are ventilated to the rooftop, a necessary precaution as these machines generate a lot of heat while they are operating 2 . I could not find any record of the TOA Electric Company manufacturing movie projectors—their corporate history seems more focused on loudspeakers and audio recording equipment 3 . Perhaps they were a distributor for another company? View Image Details A closer look at a set of portholes: one for the stream of light from the projector, another for the projectionist to monitor the screening and ensure correct alignment of the equipment. View Image Details A closer look at the casing of one of the projectors, about which little is known. View Image Details This neon advertisement for Killer Darts ( 追魂鏢 ), a 1968 wuxia film from Hong Kong, helps establish when this theater was likely in business. View Image Details One last look at Dongxing Theater on the way out. The weather had turned while I was inside and it was now a race against time to make it back to the station before the skies opened up… This was the 17th and final theater I visited while riding down the Huadong Valley in early 2018 . If you’re curious to see some of the others, read my full reports about Jinxing Theater (also located in Zhiben), Zhonghua Theater in Guanshan, and Wuzhou Theater in Chishang . Searching for some combination of Qízǐtóu 崎仔頭, a traditional name for the surrounding village), fèiqì 廢棄 (abandoned), fèixū 廢墟 (ruins), and yīyuàn 醫院 (hospital) will reveal many videos and news articles about this place. ↩ Only recently did I learn that early movie projectors were a major fire hazard—and projection booths were designed to be sealed from the outside, presumably with the projectionists still inside. Read more about the shockingly dangerous early history of film in this article from Atlas Obscura . ↩ TOA Electric Co., Ltd., was formed in 1949. I’ve seen nothing that would suggest they were in the movie projector business, but it may have been another department, now long-gone, with no corporate history listed online. For the record, the nameplate reads Super Crown High Intensity Carbon Arc Lamp. Incidentally, these projectors seem quite similar to the ones at Chénggōng Theater (成功戲院) in Xinying , but those are named Super Cow.

Dōngxìng Theater (東興大戲院) is located in a small village in the outskirts of Taitung City , Taitung , at the southernmost extent of the Huadong Valley (花東縱谷). Not much is known about its history beyond whatever can be deduced by visiting the site, but it was almost certainly built in the late 1960s, around the same time as Jinxing Theater , located just down the street, and Zhonghua Theater in Guanshan , which has almost the same design. At some point it went out of business, probably in the 1980s, and was converted into a small rural hospital, a repurposing I’ve seen nowhere else in Taiwan . View Image Details The view from the empty lot in front of Dongxing Theater. The ghostly outline of the characters forming the name of this remote theater are faintly visible on the facade—but another set of around a dozen smaller characters on the left are missing and cannot be decoded. Zhonghua Theater also featured a small set of characters to the left of the name—and these allowed me to trace authorship of the calligraphy to an interesting historical figure, a famous KMT assassin who later became a chief of police and politician in Taiwan. Perhaps that same person was also responsible for the brushstrokes on the exterior of this theater, but without access to archival footage we may never know. View Image Details First look inside the old hospital and former theater. Old standalone movie theaters often struggle to find buyers after shutting down. Those that are repurposed are typically transformed into commercial spaces: grocery stores, clothing and electronics shops, pharmacies, and so on. Occasionally I encounter theaters that have undergone novel and surprising conversions—into a recreational shrimp fishing parlour, for example—but never before have I seen one turned into a medical clinic! View Image Details The front desk has not fared well over the years. View Image Details Stalking the corridors of the old hospital. View Image Details A hospital bed shoved into a corner. View Image Details Those black wings are lungs on this old x-ray. View Image Details Dating the abandonment: April 1997. View Image Details Most of the ground floor is completely uninteresting. Everything has been stripped out and only garbage litters the floor. Initially I was reluctant to share information about this theater as it seemed quite obscure and almost untouched—but abandoned hospitals are catnip for YouTubers, and I soon learned this ruin is far from unknown. The clinic was the subject of a popular YouTube video by Xiǎo Yù ( 小玉 ), amassing more than a million views in the three years since it was published. Since that video went viral several more YouTubers visited the site to produce their own content (including a two-part video shot at night, found here and here ), all of which are readily found if you know what terms to search for in Chinese 1 . Somewhat surprisingly, the videos I perused focused exclusively on the bland ruins of the hospital on the ground floor, completely ignoring the secrets of the second level. View Image Details Overlooking the abandoned hospital inside the body of the theater. A false ceiling maintained the illusion of a more confined space. The silver screen would have been against the opposite wall in this picture. A more thorough inspection of the lobby of the clinic will reveal a narrow stairway leading up to the original projection room, which lay almost untouched since the closure of the theater. If this theater suffered a similar fate to that of its peers in Taitung it probably went out of business in the early 1980s, around when the local economic boom began to dissipate. A calendar on the ground floor provides a likely date of abandonment for the hospital: April 1997. From this we can estimate the clinic was in operation for ten to fifteen years. I wonder how many doctors, nurses, and patients knew of the twin projectors staring into the darkness above the false ceiling of the clinic all that time? View Image Details The original carbon arc lamp projectors stare blankly into the empty space above the abandoned hospital, dead eyes gazing into the darkness. The carbon arc lamp projectors are standard issue for a Taiwanese theater of this vintage. Both projectors are ventilated to the rooftop, a necessary precaution as these machines generate a lot of heat while they are operating 2 . I could not find any record of the TOA Electric Company manufacturing movie projectors—their corporate history seems more focused on loudspeakers and audio recording equipment 3 . Perhaps they were a distributor for another company? View Image Details A closer look at a set of portholes: one for the stream of light from the projector, another for the projectionist to monitor the screening and ensure correct alignment of the equipment. View Image Details A closer look at the casing of one of the projectors, about which little is known. View Image Details This neon advertisement for Killer Darts ( 追魂鏢 ), a 1968 wuxia film from Hong Kong, helps establish when this theater was likely in business. View Image Details One last look at Dongxing Theater on the way out. The weather had turned while I was inside and it was now a race against time to make it back to the station before the skies opened up… This was the 17th and final theater I visited while riding down the Huadong Valley in early 2018 . If you’re curious to see some of the others, read my full reports about Jinxing Theater (also located in Zhiben), Zhonghua Theater in Guanshan, and Wuzhou Theater in Chishang . Searching for some combination of Qízǐtóu 崎仔頭, a traditional name for the surrounding village), fèiqì 廢棄 (abandoned), fèixū 廢墟 (ruins), and yīyuàn 醫院 (hospital) will reveal many videos and news articles about this place. ↩ Only recently did I learn that early movie projectors were a major fire hazard—and projection booths were designed to be sealed from the outside, presumably with the projectionists still inside. Read more about the shockingly dangerous early history of film in this article from Atlas Obscura . ↩ TOA Electric Co., Ltd., was formed in 1949. I’ve seen nothing that would suggest they were in the movie projector business, but it may have been another department, now long-gone, with no corporate history listed online. For the record, the nameplate reads Super Crown High Intensity Carbon Arc Lamp. Incidentally, these projectors seem quite similar to the ones at Chénggōng Theater (成功戲院) in Xinying , but those are named Super Cow. This feels like one of those minor mysteries I’ll get to the bottom of sooner or later… ↩

Xiluo Theater (西螺大戲院) is perhaps the most widely-known of the many abandoned theaters of Taiwan . It is located just off the main commercial street running through Xiluo , a small city of approximately 46,000 residents on the south bank of the Zhuóshuǐ River (濁水溪), the traditional boundary dividing northern and southern Taiwan. Completed sometime between 1937 and 1940, this reinforced concrete and brick building replaced a wooden theater originally built in the 1920s. The new theater survived the war unscathed and flourished during the golden age of Taiwanese cinema in the 1950s and 60s. In those days the area surrounding the theater became known as Xiluo’s Xīméntīng (西門町), a name derived from Taipei’s popular entertainment district. Business declined sharply in the early 1980s and the theater was abandoned to the elements by 1988, a consequence of changing consumer habits, the rise of television and home video, and population outflow to larger cities. More recently it has become a popular site for photography, video production, urban exploration, and historical tourism. View Image Details An oblique view of the famous Xiluo Theater.

An alarm was raised in 2017 when it was discovered that the theater was on the market . Any buyer would be prohibited by law from damaging or demolishing the theater—but historic buildings in Taiwan are oddly prone to mysterious fires when property developers start showing interest.

Zhushan (literally “Bamboo Mountain”) is a historic yet obscure township in southwestern Nantou mainly known for cultivating tea and bamboo. The town itself is one of the oldest in central Taiwan but it hardly feels that way. Many of Zhushan’s most historic structures were destroyed or damaged beyond repair in the devastating 921 Earthquake that struck in 1999, which is why its “old street” is lined with modern buildings. Most travellers pass through Zhushan on the way to attractions deeper into the rugged interior of Taiwan without sparing it a second glance—but I stopped for a closer look in the summer of 2017 while on an impromptu road trip . After staying the night in a sleazy love motel never meant for sleep (there was no way to switch off the lights) I wandered around in the morning haze, capturing traces of Zhushan’s history as it disappears into memory. Zhushan enters recorded history not long after Koxinga 國姓爺 , a Ming dynasty loyalist, expelled the Dutch and established the Kingdom of Tungning 東寧王國 in southwestern Taiwan. Koxinga planned to regroup and eventually launch a counterattack against Qing forces in China, but in the meantime his troops needed supplies and something to keep them occupied 1 . With this in mind the fledgling kingdom decreed the establishment of military-agricultural outposts along the “savage lands” of the frontier, adapting the ancient Chinese túntián system 屯田制 to develop conquered land under military leadership for use in Taiwan 2 . In the mid-1660s Lín Qǐ 林杞 3 , one of the newly-founded kingdom’s generals, and approximately 200 soldiers set out from modern-day Douliu to establish an outpost in the interior. They marched east-northeast to the low hills at the edge of the coastal plains—part of the Ālǐshān Mountain Range 阿里山山脈 —and rounded a gap carved by the wide and sluggish Zhuóshuǐ River 濁水溪 ( 中文 ), the longest on the island. After crossing the Qīngshuǐ River 清水溪 , one of the tributaries of the Zhoushui, the expedition settled in an area of broad, fertile grasslands surrounded by mountains on three sides. View Image Details Chóngběn Hall 崇本堂 , also known as the Lín Family Ancestral Hall 林氏宗祠 , was founded in 1788 to venerate the general conventionally regarded as the founder of Zhushan. It was extensively remodelled in the 1980s and was apparently unscathed in the earthquake of 1999. Soon they encountered the Indigenous inhabitants of the area, the Luhtu branch 魯富都社 of the Tsou People 鄒族 4 , who customarily used the grasslands for hunting, but apparently had no permanent settlement there. The inevitable conflict between the invaders and local Indigenous people prompted Lin Qi to construct a bamboo stockade to defend the outpost, but the Tsou whittled their strength down over the course of several seasons, and eventually defeated the Chinese interlopers. General Li perished in the final battle and the remaining survivors fled westward, carrying with them the memory of his sacrifice to the cause of Han Chinese settler colonialism . View Image Details View Image Details View Image Details View Image Details Sometime in the next several decades ethnic Chinese established a market town not far from the site of General Lin’s ill-fated colony. In 1750 the town was brought under Qing administration under the name of Lîm-kí-poo 林圯埔 5 (or Línyípù in Mandarin Chinese), which literally means “land developed by Lin Qi”. It prospered as an important trading post on the Qing frontier, which was formally demarcated by the Tǔniú Boundary Line 土牛界線 . Ungoverned Indigenous territory was only about a dozen kilometers from the edge of town 6 . View Image Details Shùhuáng Old Clinic 庶煌古診所 (also known as the Red Brick Cypress House 紅磚檜木屋 ) was originally a rice mill constructed in 1925, but it was converted into a doctor’s office in 1938 after Lín Shùhuáng 林庶煌 returned from studying medicine in Tokyo. View Image Details Perhaps the most interesting neo-Baroque shophouse still standing on the eponymous Zhushan Road 竹山路 . View Image Details A pebble-washed Modernist shophouse on Càiyuán Road 菜園路 , likely built at the very end of the colonial period or immediately after the war. Prior to Japanese conquest of Taiwan the Qing authorities made an ill-fated attempt to build a walled city on a low hill next to Zhushan, but the project was aborted due to lack of funding and challenging logistics, and nothing remains of what would have become Yunlin City 7 . In 1920, halfway through the Japanese colonial era , the name was officially changed to Zhushan as part of a massive administrative reorganization and name rectification campaign 8 . In Japanese times Zhushan continued to prosper as an important center of production for lumber, bamboo, and camphor. Eventually sugar, tobacco, and tea industries were also developed. View Image Details The Zhushan Farmer’s Association 竹山鎮農會 still operates out of the town’s first western-style building 東洋樓 , a three-storey colonial structure dating back to 1936. View Image Details A blacksmith still at work in a century-old shop in back alley Zhushan. Much of this history is invisible while wandering around the streets of modern Zhushan. Indeed, it is not immediately obvious what distinguishes this place from any of the other small cities scattered around central Taiwan, but there are places where traces of the past are more visible. Nowhere is this more obvious than along Dǎtiě Lane 打鐵巷 (literally “Strike Iron Lane”), immediately opposite the Farmer’s Association. Here the main attraction is Lai Far Blacksmith Shop 來發鋨店 9 , founded 1881 and still in operation today. It is the last of six or seven blacksmiths that used to ply their trade on this small street , serving the needs of Zhushan’s many farmers. View Image Details Inside an old house converted into a boutique hotel in back alley Zhushan. At the end of the blacksmith laneway is an old two-storey residence recently converted into a guesthouse (mínsù 民宿) and gallery space by the name of Zhùgāo Yìlǎng 筑高亦朗 . The owner saw me snap a photo of the exterior as I walked by and invited me inside for a closer look. He was passionate about preserving something of the old Zhushan for future generations to see and experience. If you’re considering a stay in Zhushan, definitely look him up! View Image Details A solemn tiger general on the floor of the primary Mazu temple in Zhushan. View Image Details Life-sized puppets inside a small chamber next to the Zhushan City God Temple. I visited two temples that were interesting enough to warrant including a picture. The first of these was Liánxìng Temple 連興宮, which venerates the Māzǔ 媽祖 , patron of sailors, fishermen, and other seafarers. You might wonder about the utility of revering a sea goddess this far inland—but Mazu’s popularity in Taiwan is readily understood as a debt of gratitude for ensuring the safe passage of their ancestors across the treacherous black ditch (hēishuǐgōu 黑水溝, namely the Taiwan Strait ). I also had a look at the Língdé City God Temple 靈德城隍廟 to scope out their manifestations of various underworld gods. A chamber next to the main hall caught my eye with its many life-sized puppets depicting Qī Yé 七爺, Bā Yé 八爺, Ox-Head 牛頭, and Horse-Face 馬面. View Image Details The functional modernism of Zhushan Bus Station 竹山站 isn’t something you see very often these days.

View Image Details The entrance to the food processing factory is emblazoned with the character for “pine”. This building was demolished in 2018. Zhushan Shinto Shrine 竹山神社 was constructed on a low outcrop on the northwestern side of town in 1938 and dismantled in the decades after the war. The original shrine and several associated structures are long gone but many artifacts remain scattered across Zhushan Park 竹山公園 and the surrounding area. The most prominent of these is the torii (鳥居) spanning the road leading to the park—although I’m not sure this is the original or a copy. Inside the park you’ll find numerous stone lanterns (their inscriptions defaced, of course) and a pair of guardian lions.

Heading west and out of town, I went to investigate a poorly-planned subdevelopment near the former Zhushan Sugar Factory 竹山製糖 , and soon continued west into Linnei in neighbouring Yunlin .

This series will continue into southeastern Changhua before heading south into Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan, and Kaohsiung, so stay tuned. Koxinga, or Zhèng Chénggōng 鄭成功 as he is known to Taiwanese, perished only six months into his reign, which is formally known as the Ming-Zheng era. The decree mentioned in the text, formally known as “屯田之制，以拓番地” (and sometimes referred to as “寓兵於農，兵農合一”), was made in 1665 by Zhèng Jīng 鄭經 , Koxinga’s eldest son and successor. ↩ The “tun” in tuntian appears in several Taiwanese place names. Caotun , also in Nantou, is one example, and Taichung , traditionally known as Dàtún 大屯, contains several more: Beitun , Xitun , and Nantun . ↩ Lin Qi’s name is written in a variety of different ways depending on the source—林圮, 林屺, and 林杞, among them. For reasons I don’t yet understand the second character of the town named in his honour is similar to but not one of those variations. Perhaps it is worth noting that Zhushan was a frontier town and not many of its inhabitants would have been literate for much of its early history. ↩ As with anything to do with Taiwanese Indigenous people there are numerous ways to write the names of the people, their subgroups, and their various settlements. Luhtu also appears as Duhtu in some texts, and the displaced descendants now reside in Wàngměi Village 望美村 as part of the Jiǔměi community 久美部落 in neighbouring Xinyi Township. Jiumei is also written as Mahavun or Mamahavana, presumably variations based on differences between the Tsou and Bunun languages spoken in the community. The Tsou people were once plentiful in Nantou but those residing in Jiumei are the only ones who remain after centuries of colonization, conflict, and displacement. ↩ Linyipu is a modern Mandarin Chinese reading of the relevant characters; it would be been known as Lîm-kí-poo in the Hokkien of the majority for much of its history. I’ve encountered several other romanizations in my research, for example: Limkepo, Lim Kepeau, Lin Pi Pu, Lin-chi-po, and Lim-ki-pou. ↩ The boundary system and quarantine policy were established in 1722. At that time the border ran along the break in the hills where the Zhoushui River enters the coastal plains. In 1750 much of modern-day Zhushan came under Qing control. The boundary was amended in 1760 but not until 1782 did it surge east to encompass what is now Lugu and Jiji . There it languished for a century; it wasn’t until 1875 that Shuili and Puli were incorporated into Qing Taiwan. ↩ Qing governance of Taiwan became much more proactive following the Bāyáowān Incident 八瑤灣事件 (or Mudan Incident in English) (1871) and subsequent Japanese reprisals (1874). Liú Míngchuán 劉銘傳 , governor of Taiwan from 1884 to 1891, attempted to modernize Taiwan and shore up its defences, but his projects were chronically underfunded due to a lack of support from the Qing court, and many of them were never completed. What is now known to historians as Yunlin County Old City 雲林縣舊城 was partly constructed on a hilltop northwest of town but doesn’t seem to have been put to any use before it was abandoned. It also sounds as if the Qing realized there were too many logistical challenges involved in supplying the new city due to seasonal flooding along the Zhoushui River. In 1893 a decision was made to relocated the project to Yunlin County New City 雲林縣新城 in modern Douliu, now the capital of Yunlin. Interesting trivia: Yunlin is the only county on mainland Taiwan without an eponymous city—and in an alternate timeline, Zhushan would now be known as Yunlin City! Also worth noting: the vanished city also marks the beginning of the Bātōngguān Old Road , built in 1875 to facilitate passage across the rugged interior to Eastern Taiwan. For a full history of the aborted city in Zhushan check out this post . ↩ Most names changed in 1920 were considered “indecent” in polite society, with Kaohsiung (formerly Takao) being an obvious example. In this case I wonder if an anti-Japanese incident in 1912 had anything to do with erasing Zhushan’s original name. ↩ This official spelling is derived from gwoyeu romatzyh , a peculiar romanization scheme that uses letters to represent tone. It was in official use for much of the mid-20th century but fell out of use in the 1970s. ↩

Zhushan (literally “Bamboo Mountain”) is a historic yet obscure township in southwestern Nantou mainly known for cultivating tea and bamboo. The town itself is one of the oldest in central Taiwan but it hardly feels that way. Many of Zhushan’s most historic structures were destroyed or damaged beyond repair in the devastating 921 Earthquake that struck in 1999, which is why its “old street” is lined with modern buildings. Most travellers pass through Zhushan on the way to attractions deeper into the rugged interior of Taiwan without sparing it a second glance—but I stopped for a closer look in the summer of 2017 while on an impromptu road trip . After staying the night in a sleazy love motel never meant for sleep (there was no way to switch off the lights) I wandered around in the morning haze, capturing traces of Zhushan’s history as it disappears into memory. Zhushan enters recorded history not long after Koxinga 國姓爺 , a Ming dynasty loyalist, expelled the Dutch and established the Kingdom of Tungning 東寧王國 in southwestern Taiwan. Koxinga planned to regroup and eventually launch a counterattack against Qing forces in China, but in the meantime his troops needed supplies and something to keep them occupied 1 . With this in mind the fledgling kingdom decreed the establishment of military-agricultural outposts along the “savage lands” of the frontier, adapting the ancient Chinese túntián system 屯田制 to develop conquered land under military leadership for use in Taiwan 2 . In the mid-1660s Lín Qǐ 林杞 3 , one of the newly-founded kingdom’s generals, and approximately 200 soldiers set out from modern-day Douliu to establish an outpost in the interior. They marched east-northeast to the low hills at the edge of the coastal plains—part of the Ālǐshān Mountain Range 阿里山山脈 —and rounded a gap carved by the wide and sluggish Zhuóshuǐ River 濁水溪 ( 中文 ), the longest on the island. After crossing the Qīngshuǐ River 清水溪 , one of the tributaries of the Zhoushui, the expedition settled in an area of broad, fertile grasslands surrounded by mountains on three sides. View Image Details Chóngběn Hall 崇本堂 , also known as the Lín Family Ancestral Hall 林氏宗祠 , was founded in 1788 to venerate the general conventionally regarded as the founder of Zhushan. It was extensively remodelled in the 1980s and was apparently unscathed in the earthquake of 1999. Soon they encountered the Indigenous inhabitants of the area, the Luhtu branch 魯富都社 of the Tsou People 鄒族 4 , who customarily used the grasslands for hunting, but apparently had no permanent settlement there. The inevitable conflict between the invaders and local Indigenous people prompted Lin Qi to construct a bamboo stockade to defend the outpost, but the Tsou whittled their strength down over the course of several seasons, and eventually defeated the Chinese interlopers. General Li perished in the final battle and the remaining survivors fled westward, carrying with them the memory of his sacrifice to the cause of Han Chinese settler colonialism . View Image Details View Image Details View Image Details View Image Details Sometime in the next several decades ethnic Chinese established a market town not far from the site of General Lin’s ill-fated colony. In 1750 the town was brought under Qing administration under the name of Lîm-kí-poo 林圯埔 5 (or Línyípù in Mandarin Chinese), which literally means “land developed by Lin Qi”. It prospered as an important trading post on the Qing frontier, which was formally demarcated by the Tǔniú Boundary Line 土牛界線 . Ungoverned Indigenous territory was only about a dozen kilometers from the edge of town 6 . View Image Details Shùhuáng Old Clinic 庶煌古診所 (also known as the Red Brick Cypress House 紅磚檜木屋 ) was originally a rice mill constructed in 1925, but it was converted into a doctor’s office in 1938 after Lín Shùhuáng 林庶煌 returned from studying medicine in Tokyo. View Image Details Perhaps the most interesting neo-Baroque shophouse still standing on the eponymous Zhushan Road 竹山路 . View Image Details A pebble-washed Modernist shophouse on Càiyuán Road 菜園路 , likely built at the very end of the colonial period or immediately after the war. Prior to Japanese conquest of Taiwan the Qing authorities made an ill-fated attempt to build a walled city on a low hill next to Zhushan, but the project was aborted due to lack of funding and challenging logistics, and nothing remains of what would have become Yunlin City 7 . In 1920, halfway through the Japanese colonial era , the name was officially changed to Zhushan as part of a massive administrative reorganization and name rectification campaign 8 . In Japanese times Zhushan continued to prosper as an important center of production for lumber, bamboo, and camphor. Eventually sugar, tobacco, and tea industries were also developed. View Image Details The Zhushan Farmer’s Association 竹山鎮農會 still operates out of the town’s first western-style building 東洋樓 , a three-storey colonial structure dating back to 1936. View Image Details A blacksmith still at work in a century-old shop in back alley Zhushan. Much of this history is invisible while wandering around the streets of modern Zhushan. Indeed, it is not immediately obvious what distinguishes this place from any of the other small cities scattered around central Taiwan, but there are places where traces of the past are more visible. Nowhere is this more obvious than along Dǎtiě Lane 打鐵巷 (literally “Strike Iron Lane”), immediately opposite the Farmer’s Association. Here the main attraction is Lai Far Blacksmith Shop 來發鋨店 9 , founded 1881 and still in operation today. It is the last of six or seven blacksmiths that used to ply their trade on this small street , serving the needs of Zhushan’s many farmers. View Image Details Inside an old house converted into a boutique hotel in back alley Zhushan. At the end of the blacksmith laneway is an old two-storey residence recently converted into a guesthouse (mínsù 民宿) and gallery space by the name of Zhùgāo Yìlǎng 筑高亦朗 . The owner saw me snap a photo of the exterior as I walked by and invited me inside for a closer look. He was passionate about preserving something of the old Zhushan for future generations to see and experience. If you’re considering a stay in Zhushan, definitely look him up! View Image Details A solemn tiger general on the floor of the primary Mazu temple in Zhushan. View Image Details Life-sized puppets inside a small chamber next to the Zhushan City God Temple. I visited two temples that were interesting enough to warrant including a picture. The first of these was Liánxìng Temple 連興宮, which venerates the Māzǔ 媽祖 , patron of sailors, fishermen, and other seafarers. You might wonder about the utility of revering a sea goddess this far inland—but Mazu’s popularity in Taiwan is readily understood as a debt of gratitude for ensuring the safe passage of their ancestors across the treacherous black ditch (hēishuǐgōu 黑水溝, namely the Taiwan Strait ). I also had a look at the Língdé City God Temple 靈德城隍廟 to scope out their manifestations of various underworld gods. A chamber next to the main hall caught my eye with its many life-sized puppets depicting Qī Yé 七爺, Bā Yé 八爺, Ox-Head 牛頭, and Horse-Face 馬面. View Image Details The functional modernism of Zhushan Bus Station 竹山站 isn’t something you see very often these days. Most bus stations of its vintage have been demolished and replaced by more modern structures. Today this station is still in use by the Yuanlin Bus Company 員林客運 . View Image Details A mysterious modernist building on Jíshān 集山路 . It was rumoured to be a small factory for producing edible bamboo shoots 筍乾行 . View Image Details The entrance to the food processing factory is emblazoned with the character for “pine”. This building was demolished in 2018. Zhushan Shinto Shrine 竹山神社 was constructed on a low outcrop on the northwestern side of town in 1938 and dismantled in the decades after the war. The original shrine and several associated structures are long gone but many artifacts remain scattered across Zhushan Park 竹山公園 and the surrounding area. The most prominent of these is the torii (鳥居) spanning the road leading to the park—although I’m not sure this is the original or a copy. Inside the park you’ll find numerous stone lanterns (their inscriptions defaced, of course) and a pair of guardian lions. View Image Details The gateway to Zhushan Park, site of the former Zhushan Shinto shrine and ill-fated walled city of Yunlin. View Image Details Stone lanterns at the site of the former Shinto shrine in Zhushan. There would be quite a nice view from this hilltop if it weren’t for all the haze. View Image Details One of the original stone sentinels from Japanese colonial times guarding the former Shinto shrine. After visiting the Shinto shrine I made a brief, half-hearted attempt to find some trace of the walled fortification built in this area in Qing dynasty times but soon gave up—there’s probably nothing left of it. Heading west and out of town, I went to investigate a poorly-planned subdevelopment near the former Zhushan Sugar Factory 竹山製糖 , and soon continued west into Linnei in neighbouring Yunlin . View Image Details Green bamboo harvest on the outskirts of Zhushan, not far from the site of the old sugar factory. View Image Details One last glance at the mighty bamboo that gives Zhushan its name. Thus ends a morning of exploration in an under-appreciated part of Nantou County.

This series will continue into southeastern Changhua before heading south into Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan, and Kaohsiung, so stay tuned.

In May 2018 I embarked on a multi-day bicycle trip along the majestic Huādōng Valley (花東縱谷) of Taiwan from Hualien City to Taitung City . Although I had previously cycled parts of this valley during my full tour of the island in 2013 I did so without really knowing what was there—and after five years I amassed quite a collection of notes about places I was interested in seeing up close. Several themes emerged while preparing for this trip: old standalone movie theaters , of which I had located more than a dozen; derelict railway infrastructure including stations, military checkpoints, and abandoned lines; and relics of the Japanese colonial era , particularly former Shinto shrines . This post documents my first day of riding, which only began in the late afternoon after arriving by rail at Hualien Station . I had shipped my bike ahead so all I had to do was pick it up from the baggage room, throw the panniers on, and start riding. View Image Details Every trip has to start somewhere. This rather impressive temple not far from Hualien Station seemed like a good place to start. North of the railway station I stopped for a photo opportunity in front of the impressive Gǎngtiān Temple (港天宮), apparently the largest in the city. The twin dragon columns flanking the entrance contain spiral staircases leading to the third floor. This temple claims to have a 200 years-old history based on the age of some of the idols contained in the main hall (a common conceit in Taiwanese temples) but the current structure was built sometime after after the devastating East Rift Valley earthquakes of 1951 . I was amused by the sight of a signboard depicting a woman wearing a qípáo (also known as a cheongsam ) given that social media was in an uproar about a white American woman wearing one to prom that month. As usual, I also captured another picture of Yáng Rèn ( 楊任 ) in the room dedicated to Tài Suì (太歲), a pantheon of minor astrological deities related to the sexagenerary cycle (六十干支). View Image Details A woman wearing a qipao or cheongsam indicates the path for worshippers to follow. View Image Details Yang Ren, one of the more unusual gods of Chinese astrology, inside Gangtian Temple. Back on the road, I crossed a bridge over the Měilún River ( 美崙溪 ) and entered Guófú (國福) 1 , an Indigenous village populated by the Sakizaya people (撒奇萊雅族). The Sazikaya were only recognized by the government as a distinct ethnic group in 2007; previously they were considered part of the Amis people (阿美族), who sheltered the Sazikaya after suffering a crushing defeat by Qing dynasty invaders in 1878 2 . View Image Details All that remains of the Jiànguó Shipping Company ( 建國運輸股份有限公司 ) is this marker by the former gate. I spied this while biking up the hill to the Guofu Mine. Against the mountains behind the village is the Zuǒcāng Trail ( 佐倉步道 ) and the former site of the Guofu Mine (國福礦場), which was operated by the Taiwan Cement Corporation (台灣水泥股份有限公司) from the 1960s or 1970s until it closed in 1996. Little remains of this quarry apart from a sand and gravel loading dock 3 . There is an informational plaque out front with an unusually comprehensible English translation: Sitting in a vast forest where birds and insects sing is a large, unsophisticated building. This used to be a passageway for Taiwan Cement Corp’s sand trucks. The six arches, which have become mottled with time, are now a signature sight along Zuocang Trail and a dwelling for plants and animals. In the evening, a group of bats line the ceiling of the arches; at dawn, a variety of birds fly around the arches. The storied past of this old sand mine has donned a green outfit. Nature and history have met to create a magical place. View Image Details The overgrown loading dock at the former Guofu Mine in Hualien. View Image Details Beneath the loader. Nothing fancy; sand would be pushed through the hole into a waiting truck. I came down from the mountains after departing the old sand mine, following country roads curving around two airbases in this part of Hualien. One of these airbases is partly built into the mountainside, and I’ve even heard there’s an underground runway long enough to allow planes to take off without being exposed to enemy fire. I’m not in the habit of posting photos of active military sites but there’s a famous ruin next to Carrefour that attracts planespotters if you’re curious about that. Apparently it was an art supplies shop (藝品店) at some point, but I’ve uncovered no conclusive proof. View Image Details An ugly ruin sandwiched between Carrefour department store and one of the Hualien airbases. View Image Details The overgrown stage of a rural movie theater, long abandoned. View Image Details These dummies are mandated by law to appear at roadwork sites around Taiwan. Further south I passed through what I soon realized was an old-fashioned red light district 4 . Such areas were common around military bases in Taiwan decades ago but they’re a rare sight nowadays. It was still early so I didn’t see much—just a few ladies leaning against the doorways of rundown sheet metal shacks, coldly appraising me as I pedalled by. One of these shacks appeared to be abandoned so I dropped my kickstand to take a closer look. Inside I found a bunch of cubicles separated by paper-thin partitions. Enough to get the job done, I suppose. View Image Details An abandoned brothel next to one of the airbases in Hualien. Notice the mattress at far left. View Image Details A peek inside a no-nonsense roadside brothel in Hualien. Despite the advanced state of decay you can still discern the layout of each room. View Image Details The derelict Qīngyè Banquet Hall ( 青葉餐廳 ), possibly the victim of a tourist downturn in disaster-prone Hualien. My next major stop was the former Hualien Port Shinto Shrine ( 花蓮港神社 or Karenkō Jinja), originally constructed on the slopes of Měilúnshān (美崙山) in 1916. As the top-ranking shrine in Hualien, an area of particular importance to the Japanese colonial project, it was quite extensive 5 . After the war the KMT transformed it into the Hualien Martyrs’ Shrine (花蓮忠烈祠), venerating a very different set of deities but otherwise leaving most of the original structure intact. Only in 1980 was the shrine destroyed and replaced by a building in the Chinese renaissance architecture style popularized by the state at that time 6 . Nowadays the only significant relic from Japanese times is a bronze horse (銅馬) awkwardly placed next to a stairway on the right side of the shrine. The KMT emblem on the side replaces what would have probably been a stylized paulownia ( 五七桐紋 ), a symbol still used by the government of Japan. View Image Details A bronze horse next to the Martyrs’ Shrine, partly defaced but still in great shape. View Image Details One national symbol replaces another. Heading west across the bridge I entered the outskirts of downtown Hualien and soon arrived at my second cinema of the day, the derelict Guóshēng Theater (國聲戲院). I haven’t been able to establish its exact inception date but from the sounds of this article it was likely constructed in the early 1980s. It became a second-run (二輪) theater sometime in the 1990s, briefly dabbled in hosting film festivals and other events, and finally went out of business around 2013 7 . There is a big “for rent” banner hanging over the former entrance and the owner has made an effort to clean out the space. View Image Details There isn’t much to see of Guosheng Theater at street level. View Image Details A peek through the shutters reveals that the theater has been tidied up for prospective tenants. There isn’t much to see of this theater at street level but that wasn’t always the case. The sheet metal structures out front obscure a stone-grey facade that hints at a functionalist design of some kind. Five sets of rusty spikes protrude from the rooftop; these would have once displayed the full name of the theater 8 . I wasn’t content with the shots I was capturing from below so I wandered into a nearby apartment block and ascended to the top floor to look for a better angle. Turns out there’s quite a good view from up there! View Image Details Guosheng Theater from above. View Image Details Looking east along Linsen Road at dusk. The Martyrs’ Shrine is clearly visible against the sloping outline of Meilunshan. By this time it was getting late enough that my regular camera was no longer producing clear pictures. I stopped for a tasty snack at a Vietnamese restaurant, swung by a Giant Bicycles retailer for a tune-up, and ambled down to the area around the night market to investigate a few more points of interest in the oldest part of town. View Image Details A quick power-up: Vietnamese spring rolls and coffee. View Image Details Making sure I’m ready to ride for the next few days. View Image Details Anyone want to rent an old theater? View Image Details Fares were still quite low when this theater closed. It is easy to miss the modernist Háohuá Theater (豪華戲院), a cinema constructed on the site of an older wooden structure named Wénmíng Theater (文明戲院). Business records suggest it was founded in 1963 but the building doesn’t look quite that old, nor does it really stand out in any way. At any rate, it’s been on the market for a long time but it remains well-secured so taking a closer look is not advised. Around the corner I went to check out the former site of Tiānxiáng Theater (天祥戲院), later the Zhōnghuá Theater (中華戲院), but found no evidence it ever existed 9 . View Image Details Xinyi Presbyterian Church in Hualien City. View Image Details An unusually ornate stone lantern inside the church grounds. I made another brief stop at the Xìnyì Presbyterian Church (花蓮信義長老教會) to have a look at an unusually ornate stone lantern just inside the courtyard. This is the only known remnant of a shrine dedicated to Inari Ōkami . I’m not well-versed in Japanese, but perhaps it would have been called Fukuzumi Inari Shrine ( 福住稻荷社 )? At any rate, the shrine was probably built sometime in the 1930s only to be replaced by the church by 1950. View Image Details Picking up supplies at the KKK convenience store. Do they know? View Image Details Fairground rides near the huge night market in downtown Hualien. Soon the skies opened up and a torrential downpour forced me to seek shelter in a convenience store for the next hour or so. Altogether it was a productive afternoon, especially considering I had started so late. That’s all for this update; next time I’ll share my account of riding south into the Huadong Valley and spending the night in Fenglin . Guofu is a Chinese transliteration; it is Cupo’ (with a trailing apostrophe) in the village’s native Sakizaya language . ↩ This conflict is known as the Battle of Jiālǐwǎn ( 加禮宛事件 ) or the Takoboan Incident. Following the Mudan Incident (also known as the Bāyáowān Incident 八瑤灣事件) of 1871 and subsequent Japanese punitive expedition of 1874 the Qing attempted to assert control over parts of the island that had previously been quarantined and mostly ignored. Qing troops arriving in what was then known as Qílái (奇萊 or Kiray in one of the Indigenous languages) soon came into conflict with two groups residing there. The first of these was the Jialiwan, a group of Kavalan people ( 噶瑪蘭族 ) native to the Lányáng Plain (蘭陽平原) in Yilan ; they had emigrated to the area to evade harassment by Han Chinese settlers in the late 18th century. The second group was the far more powerful Sakizaya, who had already been living in the area for centuries. From what I gather a series of petty disputes became increasingly hostile and soon exploded into open warfare. The Qing soon gained the upper hand against both groups but were especially merciless with the Sakizaya, who they were intent on clearing from the area. The Jialiwan surrendered and were spared but the leaders of the Sakizaya were captured and publicly executed, allegedly by língchí (凌遲), a torturous process of slow dismemberment known in English as death by a thousand cuts. The surviving Sakizaya sought refuge among the Amis people, were identified by the Japanese as an Amis subgroup, and only began to reclaim their individual identities in recent decades. ↩ Two scalloped excavation pits can be seen on satellite maps further up the mountain. Sand and gravel mining and cement production continues along this stretch of coast, most famously at the entrance to Taroko National Park. For reference, the Chinese name given to this kind of loading dock is zhuāngxièchǎng (裝卸場). ↩ Normally I’m more forthcoming about locations and history but I’m being intentionally vague here for obvious reasons. The only clue I’ll leave is “Starfish Street”. ↩ Several bloggers have written informative posts about this former Shinto shrine; have a look here and here for example. ↩ Popular accounts of former Shinto shrines often suggest they were destroyed in the late 1940s or early 1950s but this is often revealed to be inaccurate. In many cases it was only in the years after the Japan–China Joint Communiqué and a government edict issued in 1974 that most shrines were fully dismantled. I wrote a little more about this in my post about a road trip up the Suhua Highway in 2018 . ↩ The article cited in the text mentions that the boss also managed Xīnměiqí Theater (新美琪戲院), another second-run theater. This theater, located further south on Zhongzheng Road, has been demolished and replaced by a hotel, but business records indicate it was in operation from 1982 to 2011. ↩ The full name of the theater can still be seen on Google Street View in history mode. ↩ Tianxiang Theater was one of about 20 theaters nationalized by the KMT, none of which remain standing today. The reason for that should be obvious: those theaters were usually the biggest in town, occupied valuable real estate, and were all liquidated for cash sometime after their value as instruments of propaganda began to decrease. ↩

North of the railway station I stopped for a photo opportunity in front of the impressive Gǎngtiān Temple (港天宮), apparently the largest in the city. The twin dragon columns flanking the entrance contain spiral staircases leading to the third floor. This temple claims to have a 200 years-old history based on the age of some of the idols contained in the main hall (a common conceit in Taiwanese temples) but the current structure was built sometime after after the devastating East Rift Valley earthquakes of 1951 . I was amused by the sight of a signboard depicting a woman wearing a qípáo (also known as a cheongsam ) given that social media was in an uproar about a white American woman wearing one to prom that month. As usual, I also captured another picture of Yáng Rèn ( 楊任 ) in the room dedicated to Tài Suì (太歲), a pantheon of minor astrological deities related to the sexagenerary cycle (六十干支). View Image Details A woman wearing a qipao or cheongsam indicates the path for worshippers to follow. View Image Details Yang Ren, one of the more unusual gods of Chinese astrology, inside Gangtian Temple. Back on the road, I crossed a bridge over the Měilún River ( 美崙溪 ) and entered Guófú (國福) 1 , an Indigenous village populated by the Sakizaya people (撒奇萊雅族). The Sazikaya were only recognized by the government as a distinct ethnic group in 2007; previously they were considered part of the Amis people (阿美族), who sheltered the Sazikaya after suffering a crushing defeat by Qing dynasty invaders in 1878 2 . View Image Details All that remains of the Jiànguó Shipping Company ( 建國運輸股份有限公司 ) is this marker by the former gate. I spied this while biking up the hill to the Guofu Mine. Against the mountains behind the village is the Zuǒcāng Trail ( 佐倉步道 ) and the former site of the Guofu Mine (國福礦場), which was operated by the Taiwan Cement Corporation (台灣水泥股份有限公司) from the 1960s or 1970s until it closed in 1996. Little remains of this quarry apart from a sand and gravel loading dock 3 . There is an informational plaque out front with an unusually comprehensible English translation: Sitting in a vast forest where birds and insects sing is a large, unsophisticated building. This used to be a passageway for Taiwan Cement Corp’s sand trucks. The six arches, which have become mottled with time, are now a signature sight along Zuocang Trail and a dwelling for plants and animals. In the evening, a group of bats line the ceiling of the arches; at dawn, a variety of birds fly around the arches. The storied past of this old sand mine has donned a green outfit. Nature and history have met to create a magical place. View Image Details The overgrown loading dock at the former Guofu Mine in Hualien. View Image Details Beneath the loader. Nothing fancy; sand would be pushed through the hole into a waiting truck. I came down from the mountains after departing the old sand mine, following country roads curving around two airbases in this part of Hualien. One of these airbases is partly built into the mountainside, and I’ve even heard there’s an underground runway long enough to allow planes to take off without being exposed to enemy fire. I’m not in the habit of posting photos of active military sites but there’s a famous ruin next to Carrefour that attracts planespotters if you’re curious about that. Apparently it was an art supplies shop (藝品店) at some point, but I’ve uncovered no conclusive proof.

View Image Details These dummies are mandated by law to appear at roadwork sites around Taiwan. Further south I passed through what I soon realized was an old-fashioned red light district 4 . Such areas were common around military bases in Taiwan decades ago but they’re a rare sight nowadays. It was still early so I didn’t see much—just a few ladies leaning against the doorways of rundown sheet metal shacks, coldly appraising me as I pedalled by. One of these shacks appeared to be abandoned so I dropped my kickstand to take a closer look. Inside I found a bunch of cubicles separated by paper-thin partitions. Enough to get the job done, I suppose. View Image Details An abandoned brothel next to one of the airbases in Hualien. Notice the mattress at far left. View Image Details A peek inside a no-nonsense roadside brothel in Hualien. Despite the advanced state of decay you can still discern the layout of each room. View Image Details The derelict Qīngyè Banquet Hall ( 青葉餐廳 ), possibly the victim of a tourist downturn in disaster-prone Hualien. My next major stop was the former Hualien Port Shinto Shrine ( 花蓮港神社 or Karenkō Jinja), originally constructed on the slopes of Měilúnshān (美崙山) in 1916. As the top-ranking shrine in Hualien, an area of particular importance to the Japanese colonial project, it was quite extensive 5 . After the war the KMT transformed it into the Hualien Martyrs’ Shrine (花蓮忠烈祠), venerating a very different set of deities but otherwise leaving most of the original structure intact. Only in 1980 was the shrine destroyed and replaced by a building in the Chinese renaissance architecture style popularized by the state at that time 6 . Nowadays the only significant relic from Japanese times is a bronze horse (銅馬) awkwardly placed next to a stairway on the right side of the shrine. The KMT emblem on the side replaces what would have probably been a stylized paulownia ( 五七桐紋 ), a symbol still used by the government of Japan. View Image Details A bronze horse next to the Martyrs’ Shrine, partly defaced but still in great shape. View Image Details One national symbol replaces another. Heading west across the bridge I entered the outskirts of downtown Hualien and soon arrived at my second cinema of the day, the derelict Guóshēng Theater (國聲戲院). I haven’t been able to establish its exact inception date but from the sounds of this article it was likely constructed in the early 1980s. It became a second-run (二輪) theater sometime in the 1990s, briefly dabbled in hosting film festivals and other events, and finally went out of business around 2013 7 . There is a big “for rent” banner hanging over the former entrance and the owner has made an effort to clean out the space. View Image Details There isn’t much to see of Guosheng Theater at street level. View Image Details A peek through the shutters reveals that the theater has been tidied up for prospective tenants. There isn’t much to see of this theater at street level but that wasn’t always the case. The sheet metal structures out front obscure a stone-grey facade that hints at a functionalist design of some kind. Five sets of rusty spikes protrude from the rooftop; these would have once displayed the full name of the theater 8 . I wasn’t content with the shots I was capturing from below so I wandered into a nearby apartment block and ascended to the top floor to look for a better angle. Turns out there’s quite a good view from up there! View Image Details Guosheng Theater from above. View Image Details Looking east along Linsen Road at dusk. The Martyrs’ Shrine is clearly visible against the sloping outline of Meilunshan. By this time it was getting late enough that my regular camera was no longer producing clear pictures. I stopped for a tasty snack at a Vietnamese restaurant, swung by a Giant Bicycles retailer for a tune-up, and ambled down to the area around the night market to investigate a few more points of interest in the oldest part of town. View Image Details A quick power-up: Vietnamese spring rolls and coffee. View Image Details Making sure I’m ready to ride for the next few days. View Image Details Anyone want to rent an old theater? View Image Details Fares were still quite low when this theater closed. It is easy to miss the modernist Háohuá Theater (豪華戲院), a cinema constructed on the site of an older wooden structure named Wénmíng Theater (文明戲院). Business records suggest it was founded in 1963 but the building doesn’t look quite that old, nor does it really stand out in any way. At any rate, it’s been on the market for a long time but it remains well-secured so taking a closer look is not advised. Around the corner I went to check out the former site of Tiānxiáng Theater (天祥戲院), later the Zhōnghuá Theater (中華戲院), but found no evidence it ever existed 9 . View Image Details Xinyi Presbyterian Church in Hualien City. View Image Details An unusually ornate stone lantern inside the church grounds. I made another brief stop at the Xìnyì Presbyterian Church (花蓮信義長老教會) to have a look at an unusually ornate stone lantern just inside the courtyard. This is the only known remnant of a shrine dedicated to Inari Ōkami . I’m not well-versed in Japanese, but perhaps it would have been called Fukuzumi Inari Shrine ( 福住稻荷社 )? At any rate, the shrine was probably built sometime in the 1930s only to be replaced by the church by 1950. View Image Details Picking up supplies at the KKK convenience store. Do they know? View Image Details Fairground rides near the huge night market in downtown Hualien. Soon the skies opened up and a torrential downpour forced me to seek shelter in a convenience store for the next hour or so. Altogether it was a productive afternoon, especially considering I had started so late. That’s all for this update; next time I’ll share my account of riding south into the Huadong Valley and spending the night in Fenglin . Guofu is a Chinese transliteration; it is Cupo’ (with a trailing apostrophe) in the village’s native Sakizaya language . ↩ This conflict is known as the Battle of Jiālǐwǎn ( 加禮宛事件 ) or the Takoboan Incident. Following the Mudan Incident (also known as the Bāyáowān Incident 八瑤灣事件) of 1871 and subsequent Japanese punitive expedition of 1874 the Qing attempted to assert control over parts of the island that had previously been quarantined and mostly ignored. Qing troops arriving in what was then known as Qílái (奇萊 or Kiray in one of the Indigenous languages) soon came into conflict with two groups residing there. The first of these was the Jialiwan, a group of Kavalan people ( 噶瑪蘭族 ) native to the Lányáng Plain (蘭陽平原) in Yilan ; they had emigrated to the area to evade harassment by Han Chinese settlers in the late 18th century. The second group was the far more powerful Sakizaya, who had already been living in the area for centuries. From what I gather a series of petty disputes became increasingly hostile and soon exploded into open warfare. The Qing soon gained the upper hand against both groups but were especially merciless with the Sakizaya, who they were intent on clearing from the area. The Jialiwan surrendered and were spared but the leaders of the Sakizaya were captured and publicly executed, allegedly by língchí (凌遲), a torturous process of slow dismemberment known in English as death by a thousand cuts. The surviving Sakizaya sought refuge among the Amis people, were identified by the Japanese as an Amis subgroup, and only began to reclaim their individual identities in recent decades. ↩ Two scalloped excavation pits can be seen on satellite maps further up the mountain. Sand and gravel mining and cement production continues along this stretch of coast, most famously at the entrance to Taroko National Park. For reference, the Chinese name given to this kind of loading dock is zhuāngxièchǎng (裝卸場). ↩ Normally I’m more forthcoming about locations and history but I’m being intentionally vague here for obvious reasons. The only clue I’ll leave is “Starfish Street”. ↩ Several bloggers have written informative posts about this former Shinto shrine; have a look here and here for example. ↩ Popular accounts of former Shinto shrines often suggest they were destroyed in the late 1940s or early 1950s but this is often revealed to be inaccurate. In many cases it was only in the years after the Japan–China Joint Communiqué and a government edict issued in 1974 that most shrines were fully dismantled. I wrote a little more about this in my post about a road trip up the Suhua Highway in 2018 . ↩ The article cited in the text mentions that the boss also managed Xīnměiqí Theater (新美琪戲院), another second-run theater. This theater, located further south on Zhongzheng Road, has been demolished and replaced by a hotel, but business records indicate it was in operation from 1982 to 2011. ↩ The full name of the theater can still be seen on Google Street View in history mode. ↩ Tianxiang Theater was one of about 20 theaters nationalized by the KMT, none of which remain standing today. The reason for that should be obvious: those theaters were usually the biggest in town, occupied valuable real estate, and were all liquidated for cash sometime after their value as instruments of propaganda began to decrease. ↩

Zhōnghuá Theater (中華大戲院) is an impressive KMT authoritarian era ruin in Guanshan , a small town of approximately 8,800 in the idyllic Huadong Valley of Taiwan . With seating for 1,200 patrons it was the largest theater in Taitung when it opened in 1965, and it soon earned the title “northern tyrant” (běibàtiān 北霸天) for dominating the cinema industry at this end of the county. What explains the existence of such a huge theater in this remote, sparsely populated place? As with the more modest and folksy Wǔzhōu Theater (五洲戲院) in neighbouring Chishang , a closer examination of regional socioeconomic history provides answers. View Image Details An oblique view of the purely functional exterior of the theater, which is almost completely devoid of decorative features. Guanshan was once home to as many as five movie theaters 1 , an impressive number for a district with only 8,800 residents today. But Guanshan wasn’t always such a backwater—as with most other small towns in Taitung it experienced a massive increase in population and economic activity after the completion of the Central Cross-Island Highway (中部橫貫公路) in 1960. The opening of this highway dramatically increased access to eastern Taiwan, which had previously been only tenuously connected to the rest of the country 2 , and facilitated a rapid expansion of industry and natural resource extraction 3 . Government and military development programs flush with American foreign aid provided employment opportunities and incentives for migrants (many of them retired KMT veterans) to relocate to the southeastern frontier, and the population almost doubled in less than a decade 4 . All of this occurred against the backdrop of the Taiwan Miracle , a period of explosive growth coinciding with the golden age of cinema in Taitung County. View Image Details A better view of the characters emblazoned on the facade of the old theater. The calligrapher’s credit is located at far left. The name of this theater alludes to Greater China (大中華) and, as you might expect, it was co-founded by a military veteran, a former major general in the ROC army, Xú Jìnshēng (徐進昇). Born in Guangdong in 1908, he fought in the Chinese Civil War and eventually attained the rank of major general. He came to Tainan in 1950 and eventually retired from the armed forces to enter private enterprise, but his businesses did not do so well, and by 1961 he was seeking other opportunities 5 . His younger brother, Xú Huànguāng (徐煥光), had already relocated to Chishang, and recommended opening a theater with the help of a local doctor of Chinese medicine, Chén Jīnshān (陳金山). Xu Jinsheng moved to Guanshan in 1963, oversaw construction of the theater starting in 1964, and spent the rest of his life, alongside his son Xú Jiàndōng (徐建東), managing daily operations after it opened in 1965 . View Image Details The ticket booth beneath the awning betrays no secrets. The rusty frame overhead would have once displayed an illuminated fare table with discounts for veterans. Movie theaters operating during the many decades of martial law (a period generally known as the White Terror ) were subject to oversight by the police, and it was mandatory to stand for the ROC national anthem before every screening. This theater, operated by a veteran and so obviously aligned with the aspirations of the ruling KMT, presumably would have been subject to fewer inspections and the like. Indeed, the owner was almost certainly enthusiastic in promoting patriotic films, offering discounts for veterans, and screening free films on national holidays 6 . View Image Details A forest grows where the movies were once screened. Another interesting KMT connection is revealed by taking a closer look at the characters on the facade. Four characters to the left of the name of the theater credit the calligrapher; they read “written by Bái Shìwéi” (白世維題). Naturally I was curious about the artist—so you can imagine my surprise when I learned he was a KMT police officer famous for assassinating the warlord Zhāng Jìngyáo ( 張敬堯 ) in 1933. After 1949 he retreated to Taiwan with the KMT, became chief of police in Kaohsiung and Tainan, and eventually entered local politics. Presumably Xu Jinsheng knew Bai Shiwei through their shared experiences in the ROC army and in Tainan, although this isn’t explicitly stated anywhere to my knowledge. Whatever the case, you’re not likely to find another cinema adorned with an assassin’s calligraphy 7 . View Image Details The former stage is only barely discernible beneath the overgrowth.

Shulin is a heavily industrialized district of approximately 185,000 residents on the southwestern periphery of Taipei . Until recently it was home to one of the most well-known large-scale ruins in the metropolitan area: the former Taiwan Motor Transport Maintenance Depot (台灣汽車客運公司機料廠), more generally known as the Shulin Factory. This abandonment was far from secret—it was regularly used for photo and video production, airsoft and paintball games, flying drones, practicing graffiti and street art, and the occasional underground techno party. It was so popular, in fact, that it attracted several con artists who impersonated security guards and the property owner to charge a fee for usage of the site, occasionally extorting large sums from more professional operations, which eventually led to their arrest . As for the history of the site itself, Tobias at Only Forward has published an extremely thorough account of this ruin, and I don’t have very much to add apart from my own original photos from two separate visits to the now-vanished site. View Image Details The most accessible end of the old maintenance depot. View Image Details A sidelong view of the factory building. Each of these openings would have been maintenance bays. This complex was likely completed in 1980 with the founding of the state-owned Taiwan Motor Transport Company ( 台灣汽車客運公司 ), or Táiqì (台汽) for short. The maintenance depot is ideally located along the main north-south transportation corridor, and would have served a fleet of hundreds of coach buses throughout the 1980s. Unfortunately the company struggled to remain profitable, and by the end of the decade it was running at a loss. The grim financial prospects led to downsizing and eventual privatization, with daily operations transferred to the newly founded Kuo-Kuang Motor Transport Company ( 國光汽車客運股份有限公司 ) in 2001. From the sounds of it, this particular maintenance depot discontinued operations in 1995, and has been idle ever since.

Xinyi is among the richest and most expensive parts of Taiwan —but it hasn’t always been this way. Decades ago it was sparsely settled and far more industrialized, particularly around Wúxìng Street (吳興街), where I lived for several years in the late 2010s. This part of the city was once anchored by an immense army maintenance depot previously mentioned in this post , but the entire complex was demolished in the early 2010s, replaced by parking lots, basketball courts, and wide open fields. The former depot was surrounded by several military villages, all of which were also dismantled apart from the grim concrete apartment blocks of Wúxìng New Village (吳興新村) and, somewhat further north, the restored and revitalized #44 South Village (四四南村) across from Taipei 101. Until recently there was also a cluster of what were probably illegal houses on the southern periphery of the former army depot. Nestled into a tiny patch of land next to the mountains and jutting into the factory grounds, this community was demolished in early 2017, but not before I made several visits to document its disappearance .

URL: https://spectralcodex.com/suhua-highway-road-trip-2018/
In May 2018 I seized an opportunity to ride the beautiful and dangerous Suhua Highway ( 蘇花公路 ) from Hualien City to Su'ao in Yilan . I had previously taken this same route on bicycle back in 2013—a harrowing trip I’ll never forget—so I was eager to drive a scooter and experience it at a different pace. I also visited a number of historic sites along the way, including several former Shinto shrines , as part of an ongoing project documenting various elements of the Japanese colonial legacy in Taiwan . Much of the highway itself also owes something to Japanese engineering, having opened to vehicular traffic in 1931, but it has been continuously repaired and expanded since then. View Image Details A former Shinto shrine fancifully restored by the Taiwan Fertilizer Company. My first stop as I exited Hualien City was a Shinto shrine 1 located next to the Port of Hualien at the north end of town. In the late 1930s an aluminum factory on this site to support the Japanese war effort. Sometime around 1941 a small, unranked shrine 2 was constructed next to the main office. The factory was bombed by American forces but the shrine survived the war, presumably unscathed, although few records of the original shrine are known to exist. Apparently we don’t know what it originally looked like nor what kami (spirits) were venerated there. The factory was acquired by the Taiwan Fertilizer Company sometime after the war and the shrine was destroyed, leaving only the concrete base seen in this blog published in 2011 . Some sources I consulted suggest a storm might have ripped the shrine from its foundation but it is far more likely it was dismantled after the promulgation of a government edict requiring the removal of Japanese imperial relics in 1974 3 . Much to my surprise I found the shrine recently restored , part of a larger effort to transform the Taiwan Fertilizer Company’s newly-built deep ocean water extraction plant into a tourism factory 4 . The restoration project, completed in 2015 , was informed by clues derived from what remained of the base, photos and records of similarly-sized shrines, and a general understanding of construction methods of the time, but the historical accuracy of such projects is often a matter of debate 5 . That being said, this replica serves as a useful model for identifying several features common to small Shinto shrines across Taiwan. View Image Details The base of the shrine is mostly original but the wooden housing is completely new. This reconstructed shrine features a torii (鳥居), the traditional arched gateway; chōzubachi (手水鉢), the stone and bamboo washbasin used for ritual ablution; a short sandō (参道), or visiting path; ema (絵馬), little wooden plaques ordinarily used to convey wishes to the enshrined kami , though this replica was never consecrated; and a honden (本殿) in the nagare-zukuri (流造) style, held in place by winch straps, presumably to prevent it from blowing away in a typhoon. A pair of stone lanterns visible in pictures of the opening ceremony were nowhere to be seen. Also missing are the customary pair of komainu (狛犬), or guardian lion-dogs, although I’m not sure such a small shrine would ordinarily feature any. View Image Details A famous film studio in Xincheng, the small town at the entrance to Taroko Gorge. Heading north from Hualien I merged with Provincial Highway 9 , formally embarking upon the Suhua Highway near Jǐngměi Station (景美車站), and made my way to the old street at the heart of the small town of Xincheng 6 , the gateway to Taroko National Park . Here I made a brief pitstop at the rustic Xincheng Film Studio (新城照相館), a century-old building featured in the film Eternal Summer 盛夏光年 , but it wasn’t open. Next door is the Jiāxìng Fruit Ice Shop (佳興冰果室), famous for its lemonade. I picked up two bottles for the long ride ahead. View Image Details This Catholic Church in Chongde, just a litle north of the entrance to Taroko Gorge, preserved the stone lanterns from the original shrine after it was abandoned. After a brief excursion to confirm the location of an old sentry post next to the railway line at the edge of town 7 I crossed the Taroko Bridge (太魯閣大橋) into Xiulin and continued north to St. Bernard Catholic Church (聖伯納天主堂) in the village of Chóngdé (崇徳). The entrance to this church features two stone lanterns from the former Shinto shrine in this area 8 and a crude orange torii made out of metal pipe. View Image Details Qingshui Cliffs and the Suhua Highway. Look closely and you’ll notice a notch running along the cliffside; that’s the highway! Immediately to the north of Chongde is one of Taiwan’s most majestic landscapes, Qīngshuǐ Cliff (清水斷崖) 9 . These beautiful gneiss and marble cliffs rise from the deep ocean to the Qingshui Mountain peak, 2,408 meters above sea level but only 2 kilometers from the shore. The old Suhua Highway ran along the edge of these cliffs, following the winding contours of the coastline, but many of the most precarious sections have been bypassed with tunnels built over the course of the last several decades. Some of the abandoned sections are accessible but most are not—and without any maintenance, parts of the old road have collapsed into the sea 10 . Xiaoqingshui Lookout (小清水休憩區), located on the far side of that first tunnel while heading north, provides public access to a short section of the old highway, and many travellers stop here to get a better view of the cliffs. From here you can appreciate the immensity of the mountains rising from the deep ocean and the insignificance of the works of humankind. Both the highway and the railway line are impressive engineering achievements—but they are dwarfed by the scale of nature here on the very edge of the continent. View Image Details The view from one of the main roadside stops along the Qingshui Cliffs. Both the highway (notice the tiny white vehicles at far right) and the railway lines required incredible feats of engineering and constant upkeep to span more than 100 kilometers of terrain like this. The Suhua Highway dates back to Japanese times but the railway line running along this far shore was not completed until 1979. Formally known as the North-Link Line (北迴線), it was one of the Ten Major Construction Projects (十大建設) promulgated by Chiang Ching-kuo . Prior to the opening of the North-Link the railway network terminated at Su’ao Station (蘇澳車站); the railway lines of eastern Taiwan , which date back to the 1910s, were totally isolated from the rest of the country until this link was established. View Image Details Another gorgeous view looking north along the Qingshui Cliffs. If I’m not mistaken this section of the highway is abandoned, and traffic now flows through tunnels along this especially precarious coastline. View Image Details Looking south toward Chongde from an abandoned section of the old Suhua Highway. View Image Details An abandoned section of the old Suhua Highway around Qingshui Cliffs. Up until the 1970s this is what most of this part of the road looked like! View Image Details This boulder wasn’t here the last time I was. What was meant to be a leisurely trip up the Suhua Highway with ample time for detours became somewhat more constrained by a change in the weather. Not long after leaving Xincheng the forecast worsened, and the chance of rain edged closer to certainty as I continued north. I had no interest in driving in a storm so I ended up taking fewer discretionary stops than originally intended, which is just as well, for progress was not as swift as planned. View Image Details Part of the ongoing Suhua Highway improvement project. Construction work was visible all along the highway, part of an ongoing improvement project that began in 2011. This project was partly in response to a deadly landslide in 2010 that claimed 26 lives. Several of the most landslide-prone sections of coastal road are being replaced by tunnels, nearly 25 kilometers in all. Other areas are being reinforced, ideally to prevent the collapse of sheer rock faces and the like. Although this may sound worrisome, the Suhua Highway is far safer than it was decades ago, when it rightfully earned a reputation as one of the world’s most dangerous roads. View Image Details Roadwork dummy at the Hualien-Yilan border. View Image Details Maintaining and improving the Suhua Highway is a never-ending job. Here some road workers take a break next to a sheer rock face reinforced against landslides. For most of its history the Suhua Highway had long sections that could only handle one-way traffic. Into the 1980s there were six control stations along the highway to control the flow of traffic in each direction. Motorists had to queue and wait for others to pass before proceeding to the next stop. This can be seen in archival footage, starting with this video shot in the 1930s, not long after the opening of what was then known as the Seaside Highway (臨海道路). This video (only on Facebook) shows highway conditions in 1973 from a coach bus, the most common way to get to and from eastern Taiwan in those days. This system was only abolished in 1990 after the completion of another major road improvement project. View Image Details This roadside temple is a relatively recent addition to the highway, as this boulder only landed here in 1993. One of the first landmarks you’re likely to see after crossing into Yilan is the Guanyin Stone ( 觀音石 ), named after a waterfall located near this bend in the highway. This boulder tumbled down the mountainside and landed here in 1993, only meters from a bridge that surely would have been destroyed on impact. It has since been converted into a small shrine to Guanyin , popularly known as the goddess of mercy. Many motorists stop here to pay their respects—but this lonely stretch of highway, 18 kilometers in all, will become obsolete as soon as the new Guanyin Tunnel (觀音隧道) enters into service in 2019. View Image Details A monument to Sayon’s Bell next to the rest stop in Wuta. Soon I came down from the winding mountain roads and found myself on the edge of Wǔtǎ Village (武塔村), a settlement populated by the Atayal people , the third-most populous of Taiwan’s Indigenous peoples 11 . Here I stopped to examine a roadside monument, Sayon’s Bell ( 莎韻之鐘 ), a modest bell tower gated by another torii . At that time I wasn’t sure what it was all about—but having done some research into it, there’s quite a story to tell. Flashback to 1938, not long after the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War , when a Japanese schoolteacher working in Wuta received a notice drafting him into the military. In those days the village was located approximately 20 kilometers deeper into the mountains 12 and could only be reached on foot so some schoolchildren volunteered to help their teacher carry his luggage into town. A typhoon struck while the party was coming down from the mountains and a 17 year-old Atayal girl, Sayun Hayun, was knocked off a bridge by surging stormwaters, never to be seen again. Sayun’s tragic death merited only a brief report in the newspaper—but the story was soon spun into one of patriotic devotion, of a young Indigenous woman who gave her life to ensure victory on the frontlines. Seizō Kobayashi , the governor-general of Taiwan, awarded her home village with a bronze bell, honouring them for their sacrifice, and many more articles were written, inspiring a popular song and eventually a feature-length black-and-white film released in 1943. (If you’re curious, the entire movie is currently available on YouTube!) None of this was accidental, of course. Japanization accelerated in 1937 with the advent of the Kōminka movement (皇民化運動), a set of policies intended to further assimilate Taiwanese, and there was obviously an interest in showing rapid progress since the disastrous Musha Incident (霧社事件) of 1930, in which more than 600 Indigenous people were killed in a brutal crackdown. The colonial authorities recognized the propaganda value of Sayun’s story , intentionally crafted a persuasive narrative, and produced media to influence the population. View Image Details One of two old railway tunnels bricked up and left to the elements just beyond Wuta Station . These would have been constructed in the 1970s as part of the North-Link project and more recently bypassed by a railway improvement project. This is the Wuta No. 1 Tunnel ( 武塔一號隧道 ). The original bell and accompanying monument were destroyed sometime after the arrival of the KMT but the story was not forgotten. Following the democratization movement of the 1990s the bell was recast and the municipal government built the present structures, the bell tower and a torii , at what is officially known as Sayun Memorial Park (莎韻紀念公園) in 1998. What motivated people to recreate an artifact of imperial wartime propaganda in this place? You could write an entire thesis exploring this question so I won’t provide any trite answers here; it’s a topic deserving of further thought and consideration. View Image Details The former Shinto shrine in Nan’ao. Not much remains. View Image Details Looking south from the former Shinto shrine in Nan’ao. My next stop was the former Nán’ào Shrine ( 南澳神社 ), originally built in the mid-1930s and located just a little north and west of the station on a south-facing hillside. Not much remains of this shrine apart from an overgrown stairway; I could not locate a pedestal, stone lanterns, or anything else of interest. Obviously the original shrine was renovated, probably in the 1970s, and replaced with something—but nothing remains to provide any clues 13 . View Image Details Modern infrastructure and ancient traditions: look closely and you’ll notice a small land god shrine next to these cell towers at a bend in the highway outside of Nan’ao. View Image Details A shrine to the builders of the road, a rare example of Japanese people venerated in a Taiwanese temple. Not long after passing the small town of Dōng’ào (東澳) 14 I stopped at a roadside temple venerating construction workers and engineers who died while building the Suhua Highway. Formally known as Qìng’ān Hall (慶安堂), and less formally as Kāilù Xiānfēngyé Temple ( 開路先鋒爺廟 , roughly: “Road-Building Pioneers Temple”), it was constructed in 1997 to house the Sōnan-hi (遭難碑, “Accident Monument”), a stone memorial dating back to 1917. This stone originally featured two names but the list has grown to 13, several of them Japanese, making it one of a very small number of Taiwanese temples where Japanese people are worshipped 15 . This list is by no means complete; many other monuments to victims of accidents and disasters can be found all along the length of the highway, but this one is the oldest 16 . View Image Details Overlooking the scenic Nanfang’ao Harbour, still one of the nation’s busiest fishing ports. With daylight running out and storm-clouds lingering over the mountains to the west I was glad to reach the Nánfāng’ào Lookout (南方澳觀景臺), the last major stop on the highway before coming down into Su’ao proper. Nanfang’ao remains one of Taiwan’s most important fishing ports, and it’s one I’ve previously covered on this blog—just have a peek at this full post for more. But the day was not quite over, and I made good use of my remaining time. View Image Details An oblique view of the harbour from the side of Fortress Hill. Beyond the lookout I finally left the Suhua Highway by taking an overgrown access road to the top of Pàotáishān (砲台山, literally “Fortress Hill”), which occupies a strategic position overlooking Su’ao Harbour. Its name is derived from a Qing dynasty fortification originally constructed here in 1884, during the Keelung Campaign of the Sino-French War , and expanded in 1889. Nowadays there is a small park on top of the hill with a recreation of the original fort, which was destroyed long ago, and a pair of cannons, provenance unknown. View Image Details An old military bunker on Fortress Hill showing signs of recent occupation. Immediately before arriving at the hilltop park I paused to investigate an old bunker by the roadside. Emblazoned with the white sun , a KMT emblem, it probably dates to the post-war period, although I haven’t been able to find any credible information to back this up, nor was able to find a match for the characters above the entrance (chénkàn gùshǒu 沉看固守, something along the lines of “watch quietly and defend strongly”). Much to my surprise, the bunker was occupied! After entering with a flashlight I saw a man sitting in the darkness, completely still and obviously afraid. Without making eye contact I retreated, shouting apologies in English and Chinese, and drove off. I figured he’s probably a runaway fisherman, fleeing the abuse and exploitation endemic to Taiwan’s notoriously inhumane fishing industry . I wouldn’t date mention this were it not nearly a year since I was there—surely he’s moved on since then. View Image Details The former Shinto shrine on Fortress Hill from below. Fortress Hill is also home to the ruins of the Su’ao Kotohira Shrine ( 蘇澳金刀比羅神社 ), named after Kotohira-gū (金刀比羅), a famous shrine in Shikoku, Japan, widely revered for protecting seafarers and fishermen 17 . This is one of only a handful of Kotohira shrines built in Taiwan 18 , possibly because they were privately-funded rather than state-sponsored. As you might expect, the shrine was oriented toward the sea, and the top of the visiting path affords a fantastic view of the harbour. View Image Details This stairway leads to the top of Fortress Hill and the former Qing dynasty gun battery. View Image Details View Image Details View Image Details View Image Details The view from Fortress Hill. The old part of Su’ao is on the left; Nanfang’ao is out of sight to the right; across the harbour are various port facilities, and if you follow the coastline to the right, numerous military installations. The former entrance to the shrine was destroyed to facilitate the widening of the Suhua Highway, which snakes around the base of the hill, so the stone stairway is only accessible from the top. Clamber down a level and you’ll find some stone lanterns and a monument obscured by the overgrowth. This monument is a dedication stone with a surprisingly legible inscription—usually these are defaced—reading: established on April 20th in the second year of the Shōwa period , 1927 (昭和二年四月二十日鎮座). The pedestal that once supported the honden can be found in the park, but it now features a monument to the Su’ao chapter of the Lions Club . Further down the access road leading down the hillside is Tiānjūn Temple (天君廟), reputedly the location of the original Qing dynasty military encampment, and several more stone pedestals taken from the Kotohira shrine 19 . View Image Details The old railway turntable next to the harbour in Su’ao. Before leaving town I captured a photo of the derelict Su’ao Railway Turntable (蘇澳扇形轉台), a relic of when Su’ao was the last stop on the line 20 . I’ve already covered the function of such turntables at length in my full post about the Changhua Roundhouse 彰化扇形車庫 , so browse on over there if you’re curious about how it operated. Such turntables were necessary in the age of steam but no longer serve much of a purpose. From the look of it you might expect there to have been another fan-shaped garage at this location but I’ve seen no evidence of this, and US military maps of the area show nothing more than a railroad yard as of 1945. View Image Details On the forlorn streets of Yueming New Village at dusk. With only a little light to spare, and having miraculously evaded the rain, I headed north through Lányáng Tunnel (蘭陽隧道) to have a quick look at Yuèmíng New Village (岳明新村), one of approximately 35 settlements of refugees from the Dachen Islands (大陳群島). These islands, now part of China, were evacuated by the KMT in 1955, a story detailed in this brief post . As with most other Dachen villages I’ve visited this one was quite rundown and nearly empty. I continued on to the far shore north of Su’ao Harbour and snapped the final DSLR photo of the day, having put 100 kilometers of road behind me. View Image Details Su’ao shoreline after sunset. There was one last surprise in store for me on this ride. While heading west out of Yueming New Village into the outskirts of a small Hakka village named Gǎngkǒu (港口, in English we’d have called this place “Portsmouth”) I noticed something interesting by the roadside. It was a small stone slab shrine, the kind where you’d ordinarily expect to find a land god, so I was taken aback at the sight of a red-faced figure wielding a comical knife in the gloomy interior. View Image Details An unusual manifestation of the Five Barracks tradition; in this case, what you see here is a representation of the southern encampment of a spectral army guarding a small village in Yilan from evil and harm. Stopping to take a closer look, I realized this was one of the Five Cardinal Armies (五營神將), a tradition introduced in this post about an extraordinary temple in Lukang . In this case, what you see here is the Southern Army (南營兵將), which I confirmed by visiting the temple at the heart of the nearby village. The five armies are distributed all around the village, ostensibly to protect it from danger. I’ve visited dozens of these little shrines all around Taiwan but nowhere else have I seen straw soldiers like these 21 ; most feature war flags . My ride ended in Luodong , where I snapped up an inexpensive hotel room and finally got some rest. I was hoping to continue over the mountains to Taipei the following day but ended up getting rained out, so this is the extent of my field notes from this particular trip. As usual, I picked up numerous leads while conducting research for this post, so I’ve plenty more to see should I find time to return to the Suhua Highway. This shrine is typically described in Chinese as the Japanese Aluminum Company’s Port of Hualien Factory Shinto Shrine (日本鋁株式會社花蓮港工場構內社). ↩ Shinto shrines in Taiwan were organized into several groups according to a Meiji-era system of classification adapted for local use: official shrines (kansha 官社), which were imperial (kanpeisha 官幣社) or national (kokuheisha 國幣社) and assigned one of three ranks; assorted or civic shrines (shosha 諸社 or minsha 民社), which were ranked at the level of prefecture (fusha 府社), county (kensha 縣社/県社), and savage land (hansha 藩社)—with the previous three at the same level—town (gōsha 鄉社), and village (sonsha 村社); and finally the unranked shrines (mukakusha, 無格社 or 社祠). ↩ This edict issued by the Ministry of the Interior in 1974 is formally known as Main Points on the Elimination of Taiwan Japanese Era Colonial Rule Memorials and Historical Remains Manifesting Japanese Imperialism’s Sense of Superiority (清除日據時代表現日本帝國主義優越感之殖民統治紀念遺跡要點). Among other points it demanded the complete destruction of all Shinto shrines, although it allowed for the repurposing of common temple accoutrements like stone lanterns, as long as they were sufficiently modified so as to no longer appear Japanese. For context, this edict followed the Japan–China Joint Communiqué in 1972, which normalized relations between the two nations, further isolating the Republic of China on Taiwan. In other words, sour grapes is what led to the wholesale destruction of an incredible amount of Taiwan’s colonial history in the late 1970s. The full text of the edict is available in Chinese on this blog . ↩ Tourism factories are common in Taiwan; many companies open small museums, showrooms, and themed restaurants to host families and tour groups. If you’re curious about the rest of what you’ll find at this particular tourism factory, try this post . ↩ Yoshihisa Amae provides an accessible introduction to this debate in Pro-colonial or Postcolonial? Appropriation of Japanese Colonial Heritage in Present-day Taiwan , Journal of Current Chinese Affairs, 2011. ↩ Xincheng is also home to an interesting Shinto shrine, now the Xincheng Catholic Church (新城天主堂), but I didn’t stop there on this particular trip. Hopefully I’ll get around to posting about it some other time. ↩ There are dozens of abandoned military installations along the east coast, usually on one side or another of major river crossings. None of them are particularly photogenic or overly interesting. ↩ Chongde was formerly known as Déqílí (德其黎), and its shrine was known as 德其黎祠. What remains of the shrine is located behind what is now the Xiulin No. 6 Public Cemetery (秀林第六公墓). Previously my research indicated there was nothing to see but more recently I learned there’s enough to warrant a return trip and a closer look. ↩ Tourist brochures describe the Qingshui Cliffs as a 21 kilometer-long stretch of coastline with an average height of 800 meters but it’s only about 10 kilometers from Chongde to Hérén Station (和仁車站) and the road itself is probably cut at around 150 meters elevation. ↩ Unfortunately I wasn’t able to visit some of the more impressive sections of broken coastal highway on this ride. The most intriguing parts are also the most dangerous and the government has done a reasonably good job making these places difficult to access. ↩ Another curious trace of Japanese colonization is Yilan Creole Japanese , a mixture of Japanese and Atayal spoken by around 3,000 people in several villages near Wuta. ↩ This pattern of Indigenous resettlement has been repeated hundreds of times all around Taiwan. The Japanese approach to colonizing the mountainous interior initially involved cutting footpaths and stationing police officers in Indigenous villages. Uncooperative Indigenous groups were forcibly relocated to lowland areas to enhance the ability of the colonial authorities to monitor activity and suppress dissent. Under KMT rule many more villages were forcibly resettled in the lowlands, especially in the early 1950s, and sometimes in the same settlement as former enemies. I was intrigued to learn that Old Wuta (舊武塔 or 老武塔) is still accessible to the determined hiker. Not much remains, but if you’re curious to see the gateposts of the school, they’re visible in this post . ↩ A Japanese post made in 2009 reveals a bronze bust of Chiang Kai-shek occupying the space at the top of the stairs. Perhaps that bust is now enshrined in the Garden of the Generals in Daxi . ↩ Apparently the former Dong’ao Shrine (東澳祠) was one of the oldest in the area, dating back to 1920, but nobody seems to have located any of its relics. Sources I consulted indicate it was located around the Presbyterian Church next to Shéshān (蛇山), pretty much where you’d expect to find it. ↩ This Chinese Wikipedia entry lists ten temples venerating Japanese people in Taiwan. There are likely to be a few more since I notice one missing: the Mazu Temple in Ximending , which is home to a small shrine to Kōbō-Daishi . ↩ Older monuments related to the highway can be found but they don’t memorialize accidents. The most significant of these is the Luó Dàchūn Road-Building Monument ( 羅大春開路紀念碑 ) in Nan’ao, which commemorates the efforts of Luo Dachun ( 羅大春 ), a Qing general, to build a footpath along this rugged shoreline in 1875, part of an island-wide attempt to shore up defences after the Mudan Incident (牡丹社事件) in 1874. From what I’ve read it was seldom used by anyone except soldiers due to poor conditions and the threat of attack by Indigenous people defending their land. ↩ There is a fascinating history to this god , which can be traced back to a deified crocodile in Hindu lore. In the Meiji era the government enacted a policy separating Shinto and Buddhist shrines , obscuring the syncretic origins of customs that were later exported to Taiwan. It is also worth mentioning that Kotohira is roughly analogous to Mazu , the most widely venerated deity in modern-day Taiwan, which might help explain why there were never more than a few shrines of this type. ↩ Kotohira shrines were typically located next to major ports; Keelung and Kaohsiung both had one. There are two more slightly inland, one in Hemei, Changhua, and the other on the old sugar factory grounds in Dalin, Chiayi. Not much remains of any of the others from what I can tell—but I’ve only visited the shrine in Keelung, which was upgraded in the 1930s, losing its original association with Kotohira. ↩ This section was informed by many great posts about the history of Paotaishan; for more information in Chinese try here , here , here , here , and here . ↩ Technically Su’ao Station is still the end of the line since the railway branches off at Sū’àoxīn Station (蘇澳新站), the previous station. By what logic is it “Su’aoxin” and not “Xinsu’ao”? ↩ This tradition might be unique to the Wúwěi Harbour (無尾港) area—run a search for 稻草兵將 and this little corner of Yilan is the only place that comes up. ↩

In May 2018 I seized an opportunity to ride the beautiful and dangerous Suhua Highway ( 蘇花公路 ) from Hualien City to Su'ao in Yilan . I had previously taken this same route on bicycle back in 2013—a harrowing trip I’ll never forget—so I was eager to drive a scooter and experience it at a different pace. I also visited a number of historic sites along the way, including several former Shinto shrines , as part of an ongoing project documenting various elements of the Japanese colonial legacy in Taiwan . Much of the highway itself also owes something to Japanese engineering, having opened to vehicular traffic in 1931, but it has been continuously repaired and expanded since then. View Image Details A former Shinto shrine fancifully restored by the Taiwan Fertilizer Company. My first stop as I exited Hualien City was a Shinto shrine 1 located next to the Port of Hualien at the north end of town. In the late 1930s an aluminum factory on this site to support the Japanese war effort. Sometime around 1941 a small, unranked shrine 2 was constructed next to the main office. The factory was bombed by American forces but the shrine survived the war, presumably unscathed, although few records of the original shrine are known to exist. Apparently we don’t know what it originally looked like nor what kami (spirits) were venerated there. The factory was acquired by the Taiwan Fertilizer Company sometime after the war and the shrine was destroyed, leaving only the concrete base seen in this blog published in 2011 . Some sources I consulted suggest a storm might have ripped the shrine from its foundation but it is far more likely it was dismantled after the promulgation of a government edict requiring the removal of Japanese imperial relics in 1974 3 . Much to my surprise I found the shrine recently restored , part of a larger effort to transform the Taiwan Fertilizer Company’s newly-built deep ocean water extraction plant into a tourism factory 4 . The restoration project, completed in 2015 , was informed by clues derived from what remained of the base, photos and records of similarly-sized shrines, and a general understanding of construction methods of the time, but the historical accuracy of such projects is often a matter of debate 5 . That being said, this replica serves as a useful model for identifying several features common to small Shinto shrines across Taiwan. View Image Details The base of the shrine is mostly original but the wooden housing is completely new. This reconstructed shrine features a torii (鳥居), the traditional arched gateway; chōzubachi (手水鉢), the stone and bamboo washbasin used for ritual ablution; a short sandō (参道), or visiting path; ema (絵馬), little wooden plaques ordinarily used to convey wishes to the enshrined kami , though this replica was never consecrated; and a honden (本殿) in the nagare-zukuri (流造) style, held in place by winch straps, presumably to prevent it from blowing away in a typhoon. A pair of stone lanterns visible in pictures of the opening ceremony were nowhere to be seen. Also missing are the customary pair of komainu (狛犬), or guardian lion-dogs, although I’m not sure such a small shrine would ordinarily feature any. View Image Details A famous film studio in Xincheng, the small town at the entrance to Taroko Gorge. Heading north from Hualien I merged with Provincial Highway 9 , formally embarking upon the Suhua Highway near Jǐngměi Station (景美車站), and made my way to the old street at the heart of the small town of Xincheng 6 , the gateway to Taroko National Park . Here I made a brief pitstop at the rustic Xincheng Film Studio (新城照相館), a century-old building featured in the film Eternal Summer 盛夏光年 , but it wasn’t open. Next door is the Jiāxìng Fruit Ice Shop (佳興冰果室), famous for its lemonade. I picked up two bottles for the long ride ahead. View Image Details This Catholic Church in Chongde, just a litle north of the entrance to Taroko Gorge, preserved the stone lanterns from the original shrine after it was abandoned. After a brief excursion to confirm the location of an old sentry post next to the railway line at the edge of town 7 I crossed the Taroko Bridge (太魯閣大橋) into Xiulin and continued north to St. Bernard Catholic Church (聖伯納天主堂) in the village of Chóngdé (崇徳). The entrance to this church features two stone lanterns from the former Shinto shrine in this area 8 and a crude orange torii made out of metal pipe. View Image Details Qingshui Cliffs and the Suhua Highway. Look closely and you’ll notice a notch running along the cliffside; that’s the highway! Immediately to the north of Chongde is one of Taiwan’s most majestic landscapes, Qīngshuǐ Cliff (清水斷崖) 9 . These beautiful gneiss and marble cliffs rise from the deep ocean to the Qingshui Mountain peak, 2,408 meters above sea level but only 2 kilometers from the shore. The old Suhua Highway ran along the edge of these cliffs, following the winding contours of the coastline, but many of the most precarious sections have been bypassed with tunnels built over the course of the last several decades. Some of the abandoned sections are accessible but most are not—and without any maintenance, parts of the old road have collapsed into the sea 10 . Xiaoqingshui Lookout (小清水休憩區), located on the far side of that first tunnel while heading north, provides public access to a short section of the old highway, and many travellers stop here to get a better view of the cliffs. From here you can appreciate the immensity of the mountains rising from the deep ocean and the insignificance of the works of humankind. Both the highway and the railway line are impressive engineering achievements—but they are dwarfed by the scale of nature here on the very edge of the continent. View Image Details The view from one of the main roadside stops along the Qingshui Cliffs. Both the highway (notice the tiny white vehicles at far right) and the railway lines required incredible feats of engineering and constant upkeep to span more than 100 kilometers of terrain like this. The Suhua Highway dates back to Japanese times but the railway line running along this far shore was not completed until 1979. Formally known as the North-Link Line (北迴線), it was one of the Ten Major Construction Projects (十大建設) promulgated by Chiang Ching-kuo . Prior to the opening of the North-Link the railway network terminated at Su’ao Station (蘇澳車站); the railway lines of eastern Taiwan , which date back to the 1910s, were totally isolated from the rest of the country until this link was established. View Image Details Another gorgeous view looking north along the Qingshui Cliffs. If I’m not mistaken this section of the highway is abandoned, and traffic now flows through tunnels along this especially precarious coastline. View Image Details Looking south toward Chongde from an abandoned section of the old Suhua Highway. View Image Details An abandoned section of the old Suhua Highway around Qingshui Cliffs. Up until the 1970s this is what most of this part of the road looked like! View Image Details This boulder wasn’t here the last time I was. What was meant to be a leisurely trip up the Suhua Highway with ample time for detours became somewhat more constrained by a change in the weather. Not long after leaving Xincheng the forecast worsened, and the chance of rain edged closer to certainty as I continued north. I had no interest in driving in a storm so I ended up taking fewer discretionary stops than originally intended, which is just as well, for progress was not as swift as planned. View Image Details Part of the ongoing Suhua Highway improvement project. Construction work was visible all along the highway, part of an ongoing improvement project that began in 2011. This project was partly in response to a deadly landslide in 2010 that claimed 26 lives. Several of the most landslide-prone sections of coastal road are being replaced by tunnels, nearly 25 kilometers in all. Other areas are being reinforced, ideally to prevent the collapse of sheer rock faces and the like. Although this may sound worrisome, the Suhua Highway is far safer than it was decades ago, when it rightfully earned a reputation as one of the world’s most dangerous roads. View Image Details Roadwork dummy at the Hualien-Yilan border. View Image Details Maintaining and improving the Suhua Highway is a never-ending job. Here some road workers take a break next to a sheer rock face reinforced against landslides. For most of its history the Suhua Highway had long sections that could only handle one-way traffic. Into the 1980s there were six control stations along the highway to control the flow of traffic in each direction. Motorists had to queue and wait for others to pass before proceeding to the next stop. This can be seen in archival footage, starting with this video shot in the 1930s, not long after the opening of what was then known as the Seaside Highway (臨海道路). This video (only on Facebook) shows highway conditions in 1973 from a coach bus, the most common way to get to and from eastern Taiwan in those days. This system was only abolished in 1990 after the completion of another major road improvement project. View Image Details This roadside temple is a relatively recent addition to the highway, as this boulder only landed here in 1993. One of the first landmarks you’re likely to see after crossing into Yilan is the Guanyin Stone ( 觀音石 ), named after a waterfall located near this bend in the highway. This boulder tumbled down the mountainside and landed here in 1993, only meters from a bridge that surely would have been destroyed on impact. It has since been converted into a small shrine to Guanyin , popularly known as the goddess of mercy. Many motorists stop here to pay their respects—but this lonely stretch of highway, 18 kilometers in all, will become obsolete as soon as the new Guanyin Tunnel (觀音隧道) enters into service in 2019. View Image Details A monument to Sayon’s Bell next to the rest stop in Wuta. Soon I came down from the winding mountain roads and found myself on the edge of Wǔtǎ Village (武塔村), a settlement populated by the Atayal people , the third-most populous of Taiwan’s Indigenous peoples 11 . Here I stopped to examine a roadside monument, Sayon’s Bell ( 莎韻之鐘 ), a modest bell tower gated by another torii . At that time I wasn’t sure what it was all about—but having done some research into it, there’s quite a story to tell. Flashback to 1938, not long after the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War , when a Japanese schoolteacher working in Wuta received a notice drafting him into the military. In those days the village was located approximately 20 kilometers deeper into the mountains 12 and could only be reached on foot so some schoolchildren volunteered to help their teacher carry his luggage into town. A typhoon struck while the party was coming down from the mountains and a 17 year-old Atayal girl, Sayun Hayun, was knocked off a bridge by surging stormwaters, never to be seen again. Sayun’s tragic death merited only a brief report in the newspaper—but the story was soon spun into one of patriotic devotion, of a young Indigenous woman who gave her life to ensure victory on the frontlines. Seizō Kobayashi , the governor-general of Taiwan, awarded her home village with a bronze bell, honouring them for their sacrifice, and many more articles were written, inspiring a popular song and eventually a feature-length black-and-white film released in 1943. (If you’re curious, the entire movie is currently available on YouTube!) None of this was accidental, of course. Japanization accelerated in 1937 with the advent of the Kōminka movement (皇民化運動), a set of policies intended to further assimilate Taiwanese, and there was obviously an interest in showing rapid progress since the disastrous Musha Incident (霧社事件) of 1930, in which more than 600 Indigenous people were killed in a brutal crackdown. The colonial authorities recognized the propaganda value of Sayun’s story , intentionally crafted a persuasive narrative, and produced media to influence the population. View Image Details One of two old railway tunnels bricked up and left to the elements just beyond Wuta Station . These would have been constructed in the 1970s as part of the North-Link project and more recently bypassed by a railway improvement project. This is the Wuta No. 1 Tunnel ( 武塔一號隧道 ). The original bell and accompanying monument were destroyed sometime after the arrival of the KMT but the story was not forgotten. Following the democratization movement of the 1990s the bell was recast and the municipal government built the present structures, the bell tower and a torii , at what is officially known as Sayun Memorial Park (莎韻紀念公園) in 1998. What motivated people to recreate an artifact of imperial wartime propaganda in this place? You could write an entire thesis exploring this question so I won’t provide any trite answers here; it’s a topic deserving of further thought and consideration. View Image Details The former Shinto shrine in Nan’ao. Not much remains. View Image Details Looking south from the former Shinto shrine in Nan’ao. My next stop was the former Nán’ào Shrine ( 南澳神社 ), originally built in the mid-1930s and located just a little north and west of the station on a south-facing hillside. Not much remains of this shrine apart from an overgrown stairway; I could not locate a pedestal, stone lanterns, or anything else of interest. Obviously the original shrine was renovated, probably in the 1970s, and replaced with something—but nothing remains to provide any clues 13 . View Image Details Modern infrastructure and ancient traditions: look closely and you’ll notice a small land god shrine next to these cell towers at a bend in the highway outside of Nan’ao. View Image Details A shrine to the builders of the road, a rare example of Japanese people venerated in a Taiwanese temple. Not long after passing the small town of Dōng’ào (東澳) 14 I stopped at a roadside temple venerating construction workers and engineers who died while building the Suhua Highway. Formally known as Qìng’ān Hall (慶安堂), and less formally as Kāilù Xiānfēngyé Temple ( 開路先鋒爺廟 , roughly: “Road-Building Pioneers Temple”), it was constructed in 1997 to house the Sōnan-hi (遭難碑, “Accident Monument”), a stone memorial dating back to 1917. This stone originally featured two names but the list has grown to 13, several of them Japanese, making it one of a very small number of Taiwanese temples where Japanese people are worshipped 15 . This list is by no means complete; many other monuments to victims of accidents and disasters can be found all along the length of the highway, but this one is the oldest 16 . View Image Details Overlooking the scenic Nanfang’ao Harbour, still one of the nation’s busiest fishing ports. With daylight running out and storm-clouds lingering over the mountains to the west I was glad to reach the Nánfāng’ào Lookout (南方澳觀景臺), the last major stop on the highway before coming down into Su’ao proper. Nanfang’ao remains one of Taiwan’s most important fishing ports, and it’s one I’ve previously covered on this blog—just have a peek at this full post for more. But the day was not quite over, and I made good use of my remaining time. View Image Details An oblique view of the harbour from the side of Fortress Hill. Beyond the lookout I finally left the Suhua Highway by taking an overgrown access road to the top of Pàotáishān (砲台山, literally “Fortress Hill”), which occupies a strategic position overlooking Su’ao Harbour. Its name is derived from a Qing dynasty fortification originally constructed here in 1884, during the Keelung Campaign of the Sino-French War , and expanded in 1889. Nowadays there is a small park on top of the hill with a recreation of the original fort, which was destroyed long ago, and a pair of cannons, provenance unknown. View Image Details An old military bunker on Fortress Hill showing signs of recent occupation. Immediately before arriving at the hilltop park I paused to investigate an old bunker by the roadside. Emblazoned with the white sun , a KMT emblem, it probably dates to the post-war period, although I haven’t been able to find any credible information to back this up, nor was able to find a match for the characters above the entrance (chénkàn gùshǒu 沉看固守, something along the lines of “watch quietly and defend strongly”). Much to my surprise, the bunker was occupied! After entering with a flashlight I saw a man sitting in the darkness, completely still and obviously afraid. Without making eye contact I retreated, shouting apologies in English and Chinese, and drove off. I figured he’s probably a runaway fisherman, fleeing the abuse and exploitation endemic to Taiwan’s notoriously inhumane fishing industry . I wouldn’t date mention this were it not nearly a year since I was there—surely he’s moved on since then. View Image Details The former Shinto shrine on Fortress Hill from below. Fortress Hill is also home to the ruins of the Su’ao Kotohira Shrine ( 蘇澳金刀比羅神社 ), named after Kotohira-gū (金刀比羅), a famous shrine in Shikoku, Japan, widely revered for protecting seafarers and fishermen 17 . This is one of only a handful of Kotohira shrines built in Taiwan 18 , possibly because they were privately-funded rather than state-sponsored. As you might expect, the shrine was oriented toward the sea, and the top of the visiting path affords a fantastic view of the harbour. View Image Details This stairway leads to the top of Fortress Hill and the former Qing dynasty gun battery. View Image Details View Image Details View Image Details View Image Details The view from Fortress Hill. The old part of Su’ao is on the left; Nanfang’ao is out of sight to the right; across the harbour are various port facilities, and if you follow the coastline to the right, numerous military installations. The former entrance to the shrine was destroyed to facilitate the widening of the Suhua Highway, which snakes around the base of the hill, so the stone stairway is only accessible from the top. Clamber down a level and you’ll find some stone lanterns and a monument obscured by the overgrowth. This monument is a dedication stone with a surprisingly legible inscription—usually these are defaced—reading: established on April 20th in the second year of the Shōwa period , 1927 (昭和二年四月二十日鎮座). The pedestal that once supported the honden can be found in the park, but it now features a monument to the Su’ao chapter of the Lions Club . Further down the access road leading down the hillside is Tiānjūn Temple (天君廟), reputedly the location of the original Qing dynasty military encampment, and several more stone pedestals taken from the Kotohira shrine 19 . View Image Details The old railway turntable next to the harbour in Su’ao. Before leaving town I captured a photo of the derelict Su’ao Railway Turntable (蘇澳扇形轉台), a relic of when Su’ao was the last stop on the line 20 . I’ve already covered the function of such turntables at length in my full post about the Changhua Roundhouse 彰化扇形車庫 , so browse on over there if you’re curious about how it operated. Such turntables were necessary in the age of steam but no longer serve much of a purpose. From the look of it you might expect there to have been another fan-shaped garage at this location but I’ve seen no evidence of this, and US military maps of the area show nothing more than a railroad yard as of 1945. View Image Details On the forlorn streets of Yueming New Village at dusk. With only a little light to spare, and having miraculously evaded the rain, I headed north through Lányáng Tunnel (蘭陽隧道) to have a quick look at Yuèmíng New Village (岳明新村), one of approximately 35 settlements of refugees from the Dachen Islands (大陳群島). These islands, now part of China, were evacuated by the KMT in 1955, a story detailed in this brief post . As with most other Dachen villages I’ve visited this one was quite rundown and nearly empty. I continued on to the far shore north of Su’ao Harbour and snapped the final DSLR photo of the day, having put 100 kilometers of road behind me. View Image Details Su’ao shoreline after sunset. There was one last surprise in store for me on this ride. While heading west out of Yueming New Village into the outskirts of a small Hakka village named Gǎngkǒu (港口, in English we’d have called this place “Portsmouth”) I noticed something interesting by the roadside. It was a small stone slab shrine, the kind where you’d ordinarily expect to find a land god, so I was taken aback at the sight of a red-faced figure wielding a comical knife in the gloomy interior. View Image Details An unusual manifestation of the Five Barracks tradition; in this case, what you see here is a representation of the southern encampment of a spectral army guarding a small village in Yilan from evil and harm.

The five armies are distributed all around the village, ostensibly to protect it from danger. I’ve visited dozens of these little shrines all around Taiwan but nowhere else have I seen straw soldiers like these 21 ; most feature war flags . My ride ended in Luodong , where I snapped up an inexpensive hotel room and finally got some rest. I was hoping to continue over the mountains to Taipei the following day but ended up getting rained out, so this is the extent of my field notes from this particular trip. As usual, I picked up numerous leads while conducting research for this post, so I’ve plenty more to see should I find time to return to the Suhua Highway. This shrine is typically described in Chinese as the Japanese Aluminum Company’s Port of Hualien Factory Shinto Shrine (日本鋁株式會社花蓮港工場構內社). ↩ Shinto shrines in Taiwan were organized into several groups according to a Meiji-era system of classification adapted for local use: official shrines (kansha 官社), which were imperial (kanpeisha 官幣社) or national (kokuheisha 國幣社) and assigned one of three ranks; assorted or civic shrines (shosha 諸社 or minsha 民社), which were ranked at the level of prefecture (fusha 府社), county (kensha 縣社/県社), and savage land (hansha 藩社)—with the previous three at the same level—town (gōsha 鄉社), and village (sonsha 村社); and finally the unranked shrines (mukakusha, 無格社 or 社祠). ↩ This edict issued by the Ministry of the Interior in 1974 is formally known as Main Points on the Elimination of Taiwan Japanese Era Colonial Rule Memorials and Historical Remains Manifesting Japanese Imperialism’s Sense of Superiority (清除日據時代表現日本帝國主義優越感之殖民統治紀念遺跡要點). Among other points it demanded the complete destruction of all Shinto shrines, although it allowed for the repurposing of common temple accoutrements like stone lanterns, as long as they were sufficiently modified so as to no longer appear Japanese. For context, this edict followed the Japan–China Joint Communiqué in 1972, which normalized relations between the two nations, further isolating the Republic of China on Taiwan. In other words, sour grapes is what led to the wholesale destruction of an incredible amount of Taiwan’s colonial history in the late 1970s. The full text of the edict is available in Chinese on this blog . ↩ Tourism factories are common in Taiwan; many companies open small museums, showrooms, and themed restaurants to host families and tour groups. If you’re curious about the rest of what you’ll find at this particular tourism factory, try this post . ↩ Yoshihisa Amae provides an accessible introduction to this debate in Pro-colonial or Postcolonial? Appropriation of Japanese Colonial Heritage in Present-day Taiwan , Journal of Current Chinese Affairs, 2011. ↩ Xincheng is also home to an interesting Shinto shrine, now the Xincheng Catholic Church (新城天主堂), but I didn’t stop there on this particular trip. Hopefully I’ll get around to posting about it some other time. ↩ There are dozens of abandoned military installations along the east coast, usually on one side or another of major river crossings. None of them are particularly photogenic or overly interesting. ↩ Chongde was formerly known as Déqílí (德其黎), and its shrine was known as 德其黎祠. What remains of the shrine is located behind what is now the Xiulin No. 6 Public Cemetery (秀林第六公墓). Previously my research indicated there was nothing to see but more recently I learned there’s enough to warrant a return trip and a closer look. ↩ Tourist brochures describe the Qingshui Cliffs as a 21 kilometer-long stretch of coastline with an average height of 800 meters but it’s only about 10 kilometers from Chongde to Hérén Station (和仁車站) and the road itself is probably cut at around 150 meters elevation. ↩ Unfortunately I wasn’t able to visit some of the more impressive sections of broken coastal highway on this ride. The most intriguing parts are also the most dangerous and the government has done a reasonably good job making these places difficult to access. ↩ Another curious trace of Japanese colonization is Yilan Creole Japanese , a mixture of Japanese and Atayal spoken by around 3,000 people in several villages near Wuta. ↩ This pattern of Indigenous resettlement has been repeated hundreds of times all around Taiwan. The Japanese approach to colonizing the mountainous interior initially involved cutting footpaths and stationing police officers in Indigenous villages. Uncooperative Indigenous groups were forcibly relocated to lowland areas to enhance the ability of the colonial authorities to monitor activity and suppress dissent. Under KMT rule many more villages were forcibly resettled in the lowlands, especially in the early 1950s, and sometimes in the same settlement as former enemies. I was intrigued to learn that Old Wuta (舊武塔 or 老武塔) is still accessible to the determined hiker. Not much remains, but if you’re curious to see the gateposts of the school, they’re visible in this post . ↩ A Japanese post made in 2009 reveals a bronze bust of Chiang Kai-shek occupying the space at the top of the stairs. Perhaps that bust is now enshrined in the Garden of the Generals in Daxi . ↩ Apparently the former Dong’ao Shrine (東澳祠) was one of the oldest in the area, dating back to 1920, but nobody seems to have located any of its relics. Sources I consulted indicate it was located around the Presbyterian Church next to Shéshān (蛇山), pretty much where you’d expect to find it. ↩ This Chinese Wikipedia entry lists ten temples venerating Japanese people in Taiwan. There are likely to be a few more since I notice one missing: the Mazu Temple in Ximending , which is home to a small shrine to Kōbō-Daishi . ↩ Older monuments related to the highway can be found but they don’t memorialize accidents. The most significant of these is the Luó Dàchūn Road-Building Monument ( 羅大春開路紀念碑 ) in Nan’ao, which commemorates the efforts of Luo Dachun ( 羅大春 ), a Qing general, to build a footpath along this rugged shoreline in 1875, part of an island-wide attempt to shore up defences after the Mudan Incident (牡丹社事件) in 1874. From what I’ve read it was seldom used by anyone except soldiers due to poor conditions and the threat of attack by Indigenous people defending their land. ↩ There is a fascinating history to this god , which can be traced back to a deified crocodile in Hindu lore. In the Meiji era the government enacted a policy separating Shinto and Buddhist shrines , obscuring the syncretic origins of customs that were later exported to Taiwan. It is also worth mentioning that Kotohira is roughly analogous to Mazu , the most widely venerated deity in modern-day Taiwan, which might help explain why there were never more than a few shrines of this type. ↩ Kotohira shrines were typically located next to major ports; Keelung and Kaohsiung both had one. There are two more slightly inland, one in Hemei, Changhua, and the other on the old sugar factory grounds in Dalin, Chiayi. Not much remains of any of the others from what I can tell—but I’ve only visited the shrine in Keelung, which was upgraded in the 1930s, losing its original association with Kotohira. ↩ This section was informed by many great posts about the history of Paotaishan; for more information in Chinese try here , here , here , here , and here . ↩ Technically Su’ao Station is still the end of the line since the railway branches off at Sū’àoxīn Station (蘇澳新站), the previous station. By what logic is it “Su’aoxin” and not “Xinsu’ao”? ↩ This tradition might be unique to the Wúwěi Harbour (無尾港) area—run a search for 稻草兵將 and this little corner of Yilan is the only place that comes up. ↩

The Stanton Club (飛宏象山國際會議聯誼中心) was an exclusive business and recreation facility located in the foothills of the Nangang Mountains in Xinyi , Taipei . Although details are scant, it was in operation from the late 1990s until approximately 2005, when it went out of business for reasons unknown. Most of the club is underground—and with floorspace or around 3,500 ping, a Taiwanese unit of measurement corresponding to approximately 12,000m 2 , it was a rather large place. Perhaps owing to its relatively accessible location this became one of the most notorious ruins in Taipei for awhile, even appearing on television at times. The space was finally leased and renovated in 2018 so I am now at liberty to share some photos from several forays made to the site in previous years. View Image Details Stanton Club exterior in 2016. From the street it isn’t at all obvious how extensive it is. The Internet Archive maintains a copy of the original Stanton Club homepage if you’re curious. From this we can learn that the club originally featured indoor and outdoor pools, jacuzzi and sauna rooms, a fitness center, a banquet hall and convention center, an auditorium and movie theater, and plenty more. Not much remained of these facilities when I went for a look in 2016—but there were still a few surprises waiting deep in the underground. View Image Details A closer look at the broken sign over the entrance to the Stanton Club. View Image Details An auspicious plaque next to the main entrance.

Ventilation shafts scattered around the area provide a clue—and if you closely examine the skylight behind the main clubhouse entrance you might find a gap in the structure affording an unobstructed glimpse into the dark and murky depths.

Linkou , now the fastest-growing suburban district in the greater Taipei area, was once home to more than 30 brick factories, the highest concentration in northern Taiwan . Shèngtài Brick Kiln (勝泰磚窯), at the far northern extent of the Linkou Plateau , is one of the last remnants of this once-flourishing brick-making industry . Numerous ruins can be found across the sprawling site but the most impressive is a Hoffmann kiln , easily identified by its broken chimney. Hoffmann kiln technology was introduced to Taiwan during the Japanese colonial era but this particular kiln only dates back to the mid-1960s, and it has now been abandoned for many decades.

(勝泰磚廠股份有限公司) was registered in 1965 and remained in operation until 1983 when the introduction of modern, mechanized brick manufacturing made traditional Hoffmann kilns obsolete 1 . This timespan roughly corresponds to the peak of the brick industry on the plateau, after which brick production moved downslope to dozens of facilities in rugged valleys further south in neighbouring Guishan .

Apart from making bricks and cultivating tea 2 , Linkou was also home to an American military base in the post-war period, Shu Lin Kou Air Station 3 . Former personnel have made numerous photos and videos available online, opening an uncommon window into everyday life in rural Taiwan around when this brick factory was in operation. For a taste of how things might have looked in those days have a look at this 8 mm video shot in 1955 ; it shows an older “ladder” or “eye” style of brick kiln.

Many more kilns remained on the Linkou Plateau as recently as 2010 but the rapid pace of urban development has caused this industrial legacy to vanish almost overnight. What will come of this place? Several local blogs and news reports suggest the site could be transformed into a brick industry museum but this seems farfetched given the disinterest of the current landowner. This kiln is also in poor condition and located far from the center of town so it’s hard to imagine it becoming a heritage property and tourist attraction. The other kiln’s fate is likely sealed by its proximity to lucrative urban developments. See them while you still can.

It officially opened in 1955 and performed a vital role in intelligence gathering throughout the region until its closure in the late 1970s.

Yuanlin Credit Union 員林信用合作社 was a small town bank from Yuanlin , Taiwan , that went out of business at the turn of the century. It originated with a Japanese colonial era credit union founded in 1914 and based out of a long-vanished red brick building directly across from Yuanlin Station 員林車站 , a plot of land now occupied by the doomed Golden Empire Building 黃金帝國大樓 . In the post-war chaos the original credit union was renamed and reorganized several times, eventually giving birth to the credit union that constructed this particular branch, possibly in the late 1960s or early 1970s. View Image Details The former Yuanlin Credit Union doesn’t look so bad from the street. Note the original logo at the top of the facade. View Image Details The entrance to the old bank still bears the outlines of the original characters overhead, from right to left. The Taiwanese banking sector, dominated by state-owned banks, underwent liberalization and deregulation in the late 1980s and early 1990s 1 . Consumer confidence began to ebb, however, and a series of widely publicized bank runs in 1995 and 1996 prompted government intervention. Although Taiwan weathered the 1997 Asian financial crisis dozens of small banks and agricultural cooperatives were in serious trouble by the end of the decade, Yuanlin Credit Union among them.

The government adopted a policy of arranging mergers between failing institutions and healthier organizations ready for expansion. This brings us to Sunny Bank 陽信商業銀行 , which was originally founded in 1957 as the Yangmingshan Credit Union and reorganized into a commercial bank in 1997. Sunny Bank acquired Yuanlin Credit Union in 2001 and either closed and sold or completely rebranded its remaining branches 2 . This particular branch continued to operated for several years but was eventually closed at an unknown date, almost certainly whenever the newer Sunny Bank branch opened closer to the train station.

Whatever the case, the building was stripped of anything worth salvaging at some point—hence all the wiring shown in several of these photos. View Image Details One last look at an abandoned credit union in Yuanlin. These photos date back to 2016 and I haven’t returned to check up on the status of the building since then. Yuanlin is changing fast so there’s a good chance this old bank might be gone by now 3 . For more from Yuanlin check out this extensive post about what you’ll find around town! If you’re interested in a detailed history, check out The Development of Banking in Taiwan: the Historical Impact on Future Challenges by Lawrence L.C. Lee, published in 1998. ↩ According to Wikipedia the bank had a head office and four branches in Yuanlin proper: Zhōngzhèng Branch 中正分社 (almost certainly right in front of the train station), Huáchéng Branch 華成分社 (likely near the market of the same name on the north side of town), Jǔguāng Branch 莒光分社 (along the road of the same name on the west side of town), and Nánmén Branch 南門分社, which might be the one featured in this article (if it was not, in fact, the head office). If I’m not mistaken the bank also had branches in nearby Yongjing and Shetou around when it was dissolved in 2001. ↩ But this isn’t the only old bank in Yuanlin worth a look—not far from the station you’ll find a former branch of the Taiwan Cooperative Bank 合作金庫銀行 converted into a restaurant, Pizza Factory 披薩工廠. ↩

The government adopted a policy of arranging mergers between failing institutions and healthier organizations ready for expansion. This brings us to Sunny Bank 陽信商業銀行 , which was originally founded in 1957 as the Yangmingshan Credit Union and reorganized into a commercial bank in 1997. Sunny Bank acquired Yuanlin Credit Union in 2001 and either closed and sold or completely rebranded its remaining branches 2 . This particular branch continued to operated for several years but was eventually closed at an unknown date, almost certainly whenever the newer Sunny Bank branch opened closer to the train station.

View Image Details The top level is an utter disaster zone. Much of the rooftop has collapsed, leaving it open to the elements. View Image Details A scene of complete collapse. Without business records or other details to examine I’m left guessing about the date of construction. Based solely on its authoritarian modernist style I would estimate this was built in the early 1970s, but there is considerable margin for error. Whatever the case, the building was stripped of anything worth salvaging at some point—hence all the wiring shown in several of these photos. View Image Details One last look at an abandoned credit union in Yuanlin. These photos date back to 2016 and I haven’t returned to check up on the status of the building since then. Yuanlin is changing fast so there’s a good chance this old bank might be gone by now 3 . For more from Yuanlin check out this extensive post about what you’ll find around town! If you’re interested in a detailed history, check out The Development of Banking in Taiwan: the Historical Impact on Future Challenges by Lawrence L.C. Lee, published in 1998. ↩ According to Wikipedia the bank had a head office and four branches in Yuanlin proper: Zhōngzhèng Branch 中正分社 (almost certainly right in front of the train station), Huáchéng Branch 華成分社 (likely near the market of the same name on the north side of town), Jǔguāng Branch 莒光分社 (along the road of the same name on the west side of town), and Nánmén Branch 南門分社, which might be the one featured in this article (if it was not, in fact, the head office). If I’m not mistaken the bank also had branches in nearby Yongjing and Shetou around when it was dissolved in 2001. ↩ But this isn’t the only old bank in Yuanlin worth a look—not far from the station you’ll find a former branch of the Taiwan Cooperative Bank 合作金庫銀行 converted into a restaurant, Pizza Factory 披薩工廠. ↩

Āgēnnà Shipyard 阿根納造船廠 is among the most popular abandoned places in northern Taiwan . It is located in the historic port city of Keelung across the narrow Bāchǐmén Channel 八尺門海峽 from Hépíng Island 和平島, site of the first Spanish settlement in Taiwan , and just around the corner from the equally photogenic Zhèngbīn Harbour 正濱漁港. The shipyard opened in 1967 but was only in business until the 1980s. After many years of neglect the skeletal ruins of the shipyard aroused renewed interest in 2016 when the current leaseholder attempted to demolish the structure. An immediate public outcry prompted the government to designate the shipyard a heritage property, and the cultural bureau is now formulating plans to develop the area into a tourist attraction of some kind. In the meantime, the crumbling ruins of the former shipyard attract hundreds or even thousands of daily visitors. View Image Details A wide view of the former shipyard from across the channel on Heping Island. The shipyard is only the most recent of several industrial facilities on this site. Although the details are lost in the mists of time, there is some indication this shoreline was developed as far back as the late Qing dynasty era for the transshipment of coal from the very first large-scale coal mines in Taiwan 1 . Based on archival maps it is certain that a railway terminus and port facilities existed here by 1920, but the only remaining trace of those developments would be in some landscaping along the former railway line. View Image Details An oblique view of the shipyard from one of many entrances. Little effort has been made to inhibit access to the site. View Image Details One of several bays at the old shipyard. View Image Details Another shipbuilding bay from ground level. View Image Details A rugged stairway to the upper levels. In the late 1930s the site was completely redeveloped by the Nippon Mining Company 日本礦業株式會社 to ship vast quantities of mineral ore from the mines of Jīnguāshí 金瓜石 to Niúchóugǎng 牛稠港 in the port of Keelung and onward to Japan for further processing 2 . In 1936 the Jinguashi Line 金瓜石線 entered into service. This narrow gauge railway line 3 ran along the northeastern shoreline for approximately 12.3 kilometers from Shuǐnǎndòng Station 水湳洞車站 , where gold and copper ore was loaded, to Bāchǐmén Station 八尺門車站 , where an ore dock 4 facilitated the loading of barges that would then cross the harbour. View Image Details The view from the top of the stairs. Heping Island is visible across the channel. In the chaos and disorganization that followed the war the site changed hands several times, eventually coming under the ownership of the Taiwan Metals Mining Company 臺灣金屬鑛業股份有限公司 (informally: Táijīn Company 台金公司) in 1955. Operations continued, but the mines of Jinguashi were becoming increasingly depleted, and with an on-site smelter (the infamous Thirteen Levels 十三層), there was probably much less of a need to transport large quantities of ore to Keelung. The railway line fell into disuse by 1962 and the entire section from Bachimen to Bādǒuzi 八斗子 was permanently abolished 5 . View Image Details Looking inward along one of the shipbuilding bays. A few short years later the land was leased to the Argonaut Corporation 6 , allegedly the Taiwanese subsidiary of Chris-Craft Industries , a rapidly-expanding American conglomerate that made its name in the boat-building business. Many American boatbuilders subcontracted to Taiwanese shipyards in the 1960s 7 , taking advantage of cheap labour and local expertise to produce high-quality boats at a fraction of the cost. This particular shipyard specialized in producing fiberglass hulled ships like the Chris-Craft Coho , but it seems likely that ships of other brands were also produced here at some point. Chris-Clark underwent restructuring at the beginning of the 1980s and its boating division was sold off—likely leading to a drastic decrease in orders to this shipyard, which may have been the catalyst for its closure. One additional mystery remains: was the original ore dock adapted for use as a shipyard or was it demolished to make room for the current structure? No sources I’ve consulted have a conclusive answer to this question. The uniformity of the construction style suggests that the ore dock was either adapted or dismantled—otherwise it would seem to have been constructed in two different phases—but we’ll just have to wait for more information from the cultural bureau to puzzle this one out. View Image Details The north side of the shipyard was partly-demolished in 2016. The shipyard was derelict by the time the landowner, Taijin Company, went bankrupt in the late 1980s. Many of Taijin’s assets were sold off to pay creditors but not this parcel of land. In 1991 the remains of Taijin were merged into the Taiwan Sugar Company 台糖公司 , the current owner of the site. They leased the land to a variety of businesses over the years, most recently granting a 20-year lease to Ānuòmǎ Industrial Company 阿諾瑪實業公司 in 2008. It was this company that began demolishing the iconic shipyard in February 2016, prompting widespread media attention , condemnation by the mayor on social media, and an intervention by city officials threatening hefty fines for failing to secure a construction permit 8 . Heritage status was granted in August of that year, but the damage from the aborted demolition effort is plainly visible. View Image Details The jagged remains of the Agenna Shipyard in Keelung. Take a short stroll to the east of the shipyard and you’ll find the Keelung City Indigenous Cultural Hall 基隆市原住民文化會館, a community center and exhibition hall established in 2005 9 . The open space next to the hall was likely the site of the original Bachimen Station. Just beyond the hall one will find the original Bachimen Narrow Gauge Railway Tunnel 八尺門五分車隧道 10 built by the Nippon Mining Company in 1936. It was also declared a heritage property when the shipyard earned its status in 2016. In an interesting twist, the far side of the tunnel is blocked by someone’s house, an illegal building sure to be cleared whenever the area is redeveloped. View Image Details Statues outside the Indigenous hall. This was probably the site of the original Bachimen Station. View Image Details The former railway tunnel just east of the shipyard. Built in 1936, it was in regular use until the 1960s. View Image Details The far side of the unlit tunnel is blocked by an illegal structure. From what I’ve read the popularity of the Agenna Shipyard surged in 2014 with the release of a video game trailer featuring American actor Chris Evans . Since then it has become a popular tourist destination for all kinds of people interested in having their picture taken in the ruins. Naturally this demographic includes a great many internet beauties (wǎngměi 網美) and hipster youth (wénqīng 文青)—have a glance at this hashtag on Instagram and you’ll see exactly what I mean—but regular tour groups, families, and even the elderly stop here for photos. I’ve visited the site several times now and I’m always impressed to see aunties and uncles clambering up jagged concrete rubble to take a cool photo to show their friends!

View Image Details A dangerous social media playground. Despite its popularity and ease of access the ruins of the Agenna Shipyard are quite hazardous. The underlying structure is unstable in many places, there are no barriers to prevent a possibly lethal fall, and rusty metal protrusions can be found all over the place. I’ve personally seen people injure themselves in pursuit of a daring photograph at this shipyard. I strongly recommend exercising appropriate precautions should you visit. View Image Details One last glance at the impressive ruins of the Agenna Shipyard from across Bachimen Channel. Finally, I have two Chinese language blogs to recommend for more photos and information: Just A Balcony and Apex Cheng . Enter the Chinese name into Google and you’ll find literally hundreds of other blogs about the shipyard. Somewhat surprisingly, my post appears to be among the first full-length articles about the shipyard in English. Perhaps more will follow. Coal mining was forbidden by imperial edict until the 1870s. Under pressure from the British to develop Keelung into a coaling station the provincial authorities allowed the establishment of coal mines in Badouzi, slightly more than 3 kilometers to the east. It is possible that a light railway line 輕便線 was constructed from the mines to transport coal by handcar or other means prior to the Japanese invasion. I haven’t seen any confirmation of this hypothesis but it is mentioned in several blogs about the site ( e.g. this one ). ↩ There’s a very good chance much (or all) of the ore from Jinguashi was shipped to the Saganoseki Smelter in Kyushu, a facility owned by the Japan Mining Company at that time. This impressive complex also had a narrow gauge railway line , presumably for transporting ore offloaded at the nearby port. ↩ This railway line was also known as the Shuǐbā Railway 水八鐵道, a name formed from the first characters of the terminal stations. As with the sugar and forest railway networks this line also had a 2 ft 6 in (762 mm) gauge. ↩ If this had a formal name it might have been the Bachimen Ore Dock 八尺門礦砂裝船工廠. Bachimen, by the way, literally means “Eight-Foot Gate”, alluding to the narrowness of the channel between Heping Island and the Taiwanese mainland. The “foot” is a Taiwanese foot , however, making this span approximately 2.5 meters, about 20 times narrower than it is in reality. ↩ The section of the Jinguashi Line east of Badouzi was widened and repurposed to provision the Shen’ao Power Plant 深澳發電廠 with coal. This became the Shen’ao Line 深澳線 , active from 1967 to 2007, and recently redeveloped for tourism purposes. ↩ Argonaut is almost certainly the source of the Chinese name, although some Taiwanese observe that it also sounds a lot like Algonac, Michigan , where Chris-Craft was founded. Many thanks to Tobias of Only Forward for making the connection and opening up a new line of research. ↩ Taiwan Today has a good article about the state of the Taiwanese boatbuilding industry in the 1980s. Apparently Taiwan was the top exporter of recreational boats to the United States in those days. For a deeper dive I recommend looking up Robert Perry , a famous American boat designer who spent many years working with Taiwanese shipyards . ↩ Anuoma were well within their rights to demolish the shipyard—and Taisugar had also approved—but the site had been under consideration for protection since at least 2007. I’m guessing there might have been some interest in avoiding the embarrassment of seeing one of the city’s most visible industrial ruins disappear after years of inaction. ↩ Keelung is home to several thousand Taiwanese Indigenous people, primarily Amis people 阿美族 who migrated here from eastern Taiwan in the 1950s to work in the burgeoning fishing and mining industries. The Indigenous Taiwanese who greeted the Spanish when they landed here in the 1600s were the Ketalagan people 凱達格蘭族 , but they were absorbed into the general population long ago. Incidentally, the name Keelung is derived from Ketalagan by way of Hokkien (Ke-lâng), and it originally referred only to what is now Heping Island. ↩ The origins of the term Wǔfēn Train 五分車, which refers to the small engines that plied Taiwan’s extensive narrow gauge railways, seems shrouded in mystery. This railfan suggests the term did not come into use until after the expulsion of the Japanese, and nor does it derive from the narrow gauge railway spanning half that of the international standard. ↩

Grace Hill (Lìtíng Zhuāngyuán 麗庭莊園) is a former wedding venue situated in an industrial park in Neihu , Taipei . It opened in 2005 under the management of the Zhǎngxìng Wedding Company (長興婚禮事業有限公司), an outfit keen to disrupt the local market with a larger, more extravagant space for weddings and other events. The business struggled at first but became more widely known after it was featured in television series, music videos, and the news. In 2007 the space was leased to Dears Brain (迪詩), a Japanese wedding company hoping to enter the Taiwanese luxury wedding market. The original owners took a step back, ceding control of day-to-day operations to Japanese management, and the business continued to grow over the next several years. View Image Details The abandoned Grace Hill wedding chapel from the street. Behind the scenes conflict was brewing between the two companies—and in 2013 the Japanese company declined to renew the leasing contact. The Taiwanese owners were not able to find anyone else to manage the business and the property was effectively abandoned. From what I’ve read the property has been put up for auction at different times but there were no buyers. As of 2017, when most of these photos were shot, the complex was completely derelict, with no barrier to entry from the street.

This post gathers photos taken on two scooter rides from Puli to the shores of Sun Moon Lake 日月潭 in Yuchi , part of a multi-day road trip undertaken in late 2015. I didn’t have a chance to explore as deeply as I would have liked, nor did I really know what was so special about this part of the country while I was there, so this post will be somewhat less extensive than most others in this series. I hope to someday return to the Sun Moon Lake area and gather material to make a fully informed post about this fascinating part of Taiwan .

Although the river running through this gorge is sometimes referred to as Yémǎ Creek 耶馬溪, this is actually a reference to Yabakei , a similarly scenic spot in Kyushu, Japan . In the early Japanese colonial era this area was commonly featured on postcards, and its likeness with a landscape familiar to Japanese earned it this nickname. In actuality, it is the Nángǎng Creek 南港溪 flowing down the valley and into the Puli Basin 1 . View Image Details The remains of an old railway bridge in Niudong Canyon. Niudong Canyon was also among the primary means of travel to Puli in colonial times. A light railway was laid here sometime in the 1910s, initially to transport material to and from the Puli Sugar Factory 埔裏社製糖所 by way of Shuili , and later to assist in the construction of various elements of the immense Sun Moon Lake Hydroelectric Project 日月潭水力電氣工事 . Tourists were also accommodated on this route at some point, but it seems as if handcars were the primary mode of passenger transport rather than steam engines. Two tunnels and a pair of bridges were constructed in this canyon in colonial times. Only Wòlóngdòng Tunnel 臥龍洞隧道 remains readily accessible to the public but it was the far pylon of the Sister Bridge 姐妹橋 2 that caught my eye. View Image Details An extensive pigeon coop in Yuchi. Rather than head into Yuchi proper I elected to turn onto a small side road leading through the tiny hamlet of Sīmǎ’àn 司馬按. Unbeknownst to me this was once the site of a railway depot for an electric tramway leading to Wǔjiè Dam 武界壩 (described in a previous post in this series ). This depot was an embarkation point for workers and supplies destined to construction sites deeper into the mountains. Material excavated while building Wujie Dam and the associated water diversion tunnel was also transported down from the mountains and used to fill Shuǐshè Dam 水社壩, the embankment dam on the northwestern shore of Sun Moon Lake.

Soon thereafter I came down from a small mountain road and formally arrived at Sun Moon Lake, one of the most popular tourist attractions in Taiwan. The lake is circled by a highway, a separated bike path, numerous hotels and restaurants, dozens of temples, and no shortage of scenic viewpoints. My first stop was at Wénwǔ Temple 文武廟 , one of the largest on the northern shore of the lake. It was designed by Taiwan-born temple architect Xiè Zìnán 謝自南 and completed in 1975. View Image Details Overlooking the bike path that runs around Sun Moon Lake. View Image Details A chain of floating islands near the northeast side of Sun Moon Lake. I was intrigued by the sight of what appeared to be floating islands in the lake after leaving the temple behind. Turns out these are indeed what they seem to be: artificial floating islands, known in Chinese as réngōng fúdǎo 人工浮島, typically made with a bamboo frame. These were once a common sight on Sun Moon Lake and, from what I read in various media reports, they seem to be making a comeback.

This post gathers photos taken on two scooter rides from Puli to the shores of Sun Moon Lake 日月潭 in Yuchi , part of a multi-day road trip undertaken in late 2015. I didn’t have a chance to explore as deeply as I would have liked, nor did I really know what was so special about this part of the country while I was there, so this post will be somewhat less extensive than most others in this series.

Along the way I noticed many bunkers and sentry posts, remnants of a time when this entire mountainside was under military control and strictly off-limits to civilians. One bunker in particular struck me as particularly pleasing, for it was little more than a door in the forest, a dark promise surrounded by a vivid shade of green. For reference, this place is located on the eastern flank of the modest Wénjiānshān (文間山), and for more about the area you can consult Chinese language blogs here and here .

Dàhuá Theater 大華戲院 is an early post-war movie theater in the grim northern port town of Keelung City , Taiwan . It was in business as early as 1949 and officially registered by 1952. Beyond that, little trace of it can be found online. Until recently I assumed this theater had been demolished, just like every other vintage standalone in downtown Keelung, one of the most densely-packed urban environments in the nation. Acting on a tip that a signboard was still in place I went to scope it out one afternoon in 2018—and was completely surprised to find the theater still standing, albeit in an extremely dilapidated condition. View Image Details A glimpse of the Modernist facade of the Dahua Theater in Keelung. It isn’t easy to see; there’s not much clearance in the busy laneway out front. This old theater is located on a narrow laneway on the edge of one of Keelung’s many red light districts 1 . I’ve wandered through this area several times before but never noticed it looming overhead, likely because I was too busy dodging scooters and avoiding eye contact. This time around I spoke with several vendors across the way to ask about the theater. One woman told me its been closed for at least 30 or 40 years, a rather long period of time for a large building to remain derelict in a city with such limited space. Why the theater hasn’t been completely torn down is a mystery I wasn’t able to resolve—but it’s probably a familiar story, one involving shares distributed among many disinterested descendants of the original owners. View Image Details Behind the barrier: piles of trash; a metal gate, rusted shut; and the smooth contours of the former ticket booth. View Image Details The lobby of the old theater is used for storage and dumping trash. View Image Details Garbage just inside the rusty metal gate pictured above. View Image Details First glimpse of the theater hall, stripped clean and now overgrown. Finding a way inside wasn’t too difficult, and nobody seemed to mind, but I don’t recommend trying it yourself. This is one of the more repulsive ruins I’ve explored in a while thanks to the sheer amount of garbage that has been dumped around the entrance. Much like my visit to Fengzhong Theater 豐中戲院 in Taichung , I was reminded of a certain scene in Star Wars: A New Hope . Anyway, it was worth doing once—but only because I’m working on this crazy project . View Image Details The far wall of the theater. View Image Details Nature has reclaimed this old theater, now an open air cinema. No trace of the roof, screen, or seating remains, and the interior is almost completely bereft of interesting artifacts. Only a red brick and reinforced concrete shell remains of the body of the theater but the front of the structure is relatively intact. Walk inside, turn toward the exit, and you will observe four slots on the brick wall, one pair for each projector 2 . Gazing up, you might also notice the protrusion of a bifurcated metal tube, the hallmark of carbon arc projectors , which overheat without adequate ventilation. This medium-sized theater might have accommodated upwards of 600 to 800 patrons at its peak, but nowadays the former seating area is overgrown by long grass and sticky weeds. Technically this might be the largest expanse of green space in the flatlands around the foot of the harbour and north of the railway line. View Image Details A diesel generator in a small room at the side of the building. I was intrigued to discover an old Hercules brand diesel generator in a side room on the ground floor, something I’ve never noticed in any other theater. Was this generator employed at a time when Taiwan’s electricity supply was unreliable? From what little I’ve read it sounds like Hercules supplied a huge amount of equipment to the US military during World War II. Could this unit have arrived with the American military presence in the 1950s? Keelung was the main port of entry for American military personnel for subsequent decades, so it certainly seems possible. View Image Details Rusted shut along the side of the theater. View Image Details Another view of the theater from along the narrow laneway. It’s impossible to get a good photo of the facade without gaining access to a nearby rooftop, something I was unable to accomplish. View Image Details Dahua Theater from the entrance to the laneway. The sign is in great shape considering its reputed age. View Image Details One last glance at the rewilding of Dahua Theater, a secret garden in the downtown core of Keelung. Ultimately I have far more questions than answers about Dahua Theater. It is somewhat strange to find an old and obviously historic theater without much of an online footprint. It is occasionally mentioned on message forums in nostalgic threads reminiscing about growing up in Keelung—but without photographs I figured it must have been destroyed along with the others 3 . Chancing upon an early post-war theater like this one is a rare treat, and a worthwhile addition to the ever-growing collection . Update : this theater was demolished in early 2021. Thanks to Jason for the tip in the comments below! This laneway is so narrow that it doesn’t appear on Google Street View, a tool I regularly use for advance research. Usually I verify the existence and condition of a ruin before making a visit—so my astonishment upon finding this theater was entirely genuine. Oh, and that red light district? Keelung is a port town, so don’t act surprised. ↩ One slot is for the projector, the other allows for the projectionist to ensure the correct alignment of the device. ↩ Keelung was home to dozens of movie theaters in the booming years of the Taiwan Economic Miracle . Only two others remain in the vicinity of the downtown core—and neither of them are nearly as old. ↩

URL: https://spectralcodex.com/taiwan-summer-road-trip-2017-taichung-to-nantou/
In the summer of 2017 I embarked upon a series of road trips around central and southern Taiwan . I began in Taichung and ended up riding as far south as Kaohsiung over the course of several months. It was not one continuous journey; I would head south, ride for several days, stash the scooter at a train station, and return to my residence in Taipei before doing it all over again. There wasn’t a lot of planning involved, nor were these trips entirely random. Usually I had some idea of what to see and where to go, but there were also many serendipitous discoveries along the way. Ultimately I gathered material for more than 50 posts, many of which have already been published. This introductory post gathers an assortment of photos from the first segment of the trip from Taichung to Nantou , with particular emphasis on the districts of Taiping , Puli , and Shuili . View Image Details The rundown facade of the Mingzhi Building in Taichung, notable mainly for the use of a rare character in its name. Prior to getting started I snapped a photograph of the Míngzhì Building (朙志樓), a rundown residential complex for teachers at the school of the same name. At the time I was perplexed by the first character—an ancient variant of the standard Ming (“bright”) commonly seen in place names around Taiwan—and it turns out I’m not the only one! A quick search revealed an entire Taiwanese news segment on the character, in no small part because of the colloquial usage of the character jiǒng 囧 , commonly used to signify embarrassment (for what I hope are obvious reasons), not unlike saying “oops” in English. From what I gather most Taiwanese would see this and think it were some kind of prank! View Image Details The journey begins under ominous skies in Taichung. The journey began after picking up a scooter near Taichung Station and crossing underneath the railway tracks. I was starting later in the day than I would have liked—and the weather forecast was not promising, as the ominous skies in several of these photos would suggest. After taking a similar trip two years prior to this I was intent on trying a new route to Nantou, one that involved riding into the mountains, so I kept a close eye on the radar to ensure I didn’t end up caught in a torrential downpour far from shelter. With this on my mind I paused to snap a picture of the impressive Guānyīn (觀音) statue in front of Címíng Monastery (慈明寺) while exiting the city. View Image Details Taiping Tobacco Market, one of the very last of its kind. View Image Details Late into the afternoon at the Dongping Tobacco Barn . I made a few stops on the way into the mountains, mostly to check up on some places I had already visited earlier in 2017. The first of these was the historic Taiping Tobacco Market (太平買菸場), an unassuming building still undergoing restoration work (and opened to the public since then). The Taichung Basin (臺中盆地) was once home to a thriving tobacco cultivation and manufacturing industry , several remnants of which have already been documented at length on this blog, but this is the only surviving tobacco marketplace. Not far up the road, if you know precisely which alleyway to take, you’ll also find the ruins of one of the few remaining tobacco barns in the area. View Image Details Checking up on the Japanese colonial era Toubiankeng Police Station. Further east, nestled in the low hills just beyond the edge of the basin, you’ll find the Japanese colonial era Toubiankeng Police Station, abandoned but still in decent condition and slated for restoration. I captured much nicer photos in better light on a previous trip so check out this post if you’re curious, or consult my article about the Wuri Police Station for more about such heritage buildings. View Image Details The entrance to Huguo Qingliang Temple, a sprawling complex in the hills above Taichung. View Image Details The quirky bridge to the underwhelming Toubiankeng Bat Cave. The weather forecast looked somewhat better by the time I was departing the police station so I committed to riding Highway 136 ( 市道136號 ) all the way into Nantou. Heading higher into the hills I eventually reached the resplendent Hùguó Qīngliáng Temple (護國清涼寺) and dropped the kickstand to scope out the intriguingly-named Tóubiànkēng Bat Cave ( 頭汴坑蝙蝠洞 ). A quick inspection revealed nothing of interest apart from a rather cool bridge—but if you consult the previous link (in Chinese), you’ll learn the name is somewhat misleading. The “cave” is manmade; it’s an old water diversion channel, part of an irrigation system constructed centuries ago. The channel was colonized by bats after it fell out of use—but from what I’ve read the bat colony dispersed in the aftermath of the devastating 921 Earthquake . View Image Details Sundown over a temple complex in the hills of Taiping District, Taichung. View Image Details Downtown Taichung and the huge power plant on the coast are faintly visible in this image captured at Chikanding, an area popular with motorbikers and cyclists. Forging on, the sun broke through the clouds, and crepuscular rays fell from the sky.

I would not return for several months. Soon I crossed into Guoxing , Nantou, and began the languorous descent toward Provincial Highway 14 ( 台14線 ), the usual route to Puli (if you’re on a scooter or bicycle anyway). Along the way I enjoyed a great lateral view of the Ninety-Nine Peaks ( 九九峰 ), one of many unusual landscapes in central Taiwan.

While I was there I visited one point of interest: an old tuberculosis sanatorium nestled in the hills on the northeast side of town.

I’ve stopped here several times over the years but never knew what was so special about this temple until doing a little research for this article. Turns out that the cave beneath the temple contains a freshwater spring with legendary properties. The story goes like this: one day a camphor speculator 1 fell ill, drank from the waters of this spring, and was cured.

URL: https://spectralcodex.com/taiwan-summer-road-trip-2017-taichung-to-nantou/
In the summer of 2017 I embarked upon a series of road trips around central and southern Taiwan . I began in Taichung and ended up riding as far south as Kaohsiung over the course of several months. It was not one continuous journey; I would head south, ride for several days, stash the scooter at a train station, and return to my residence in Taipei before doing it all over again. There wasn’t a lot of planning involved, nor were these trips entirely random. Usually I had some idea of what to see and where to go, but there were also many serendipitous discoveries along the way. Ultimately I gathered material for more than 50 posts, many of which have already been published. This introductory post gathers an assortment of photos from the first segment of the trip from Taichung to Nantou , with particular emphasis on the districts of Taiping , Puli , and Shuili . View Image Details The rundown facade of the Mingzhi Building in Taichung, notable mainly for the use of a rare character in its name. Prior to getting started I snapped a photograph of the Míngzhì Building (朙志樓), a rundown residential complex for teachers at the school of the same name. At the time I was perplexed by the first character—an ancient variant of the standard Ming (“bright”) commonly seen in place names around Taiwan—and it turns out I’m not the only one! A quick search revealed an entire Taiwanese news segment on the character, in no small part because of the colloquial usage of the character jiǒng 囧 , commonly used to signify embarrassment (for what I hope are obvious reasons), not unlike saying “oops” in English. From what I gather most Taiwanese would see this and think it were some kind of prank! View Image Details The journey begins under ominous skies in Taichung. The journey began after picking up a scooter near Taichung Station and crossing underneath the railway tracks. I was starting later in the day than I would have liked—and the weather forecast was not promising, as the ominous skies in several of these photos would suggest. After taking a similar trip two years prior to this I was intent on trying a new route to Nantou, one that involved riding into the mountains, so I kept a close eye on the radar to ensure I didn’t end up caught in a torrential downpour far from shelter. With this on my mind I paused to snap a picture of the impressive Guānyīn (觀音) statue in front of Címíng Monastery (慈明寺) while exiting the city. View Image Details Taiping Tobacco Market, one of the very last of its kind. View Image Details Late into the afternoon at the Dongping Tobacco Barn . I made a few stops on the way into the mountains, mostly to check up on some places I had already visited earlier in 2017. The first of these was the historic Taiping Tobacco Market (太平買菸場), an unassuming building still undergoing restoration work (and opened to the public since then). The Taichung Basin (臺中盆地) was once home to a thriving tobacco cultivation and manufacturing industry , several remnants of which have already been documented at length on this blog, but this is the only surviving tobacco marketplace. Not far up the road, if you know precisely which alleyway to take, you’ll also find the ruins of one of the few remaining tobacco barns in the area. View Image Details Checking up on the Japanese colonial era Toubiankeng Police Station. Further east, nestled in the low hills just beyond the edge of the basin, you’ll find the Japanese colonial era Toubiankeng Police Station, abandoned but still in decent condition and slated for restoration. I captured much nicer photos in better light on a previous trip so check out this post if you’re curious, or consult my article about the Wuri Police Station for more about such heritage buildings. View Image Details The entrance to Huguo Qingliang Temple, a sprawling complex in the hills above Taichung. View Image Details The quirky bridge to the underwhelming Toubiankeng Bat Cave. The weather forecast looked somewhat better by the time I was departing the police station so I committed to riding Highway 136 ( 市道136號 ) all the way into Nantou. Heading higher into the hills I eventually reached the resplendent Hùguó Qīngliáng Temple (護國清涼寺) and dropped the kickstand to scope out the intriguingly-named Tóubiànkēng Bat Cave ( 頭汴坑蝙蝠洞 ). A quick inspection revealed nothing of interest apart from a rather cool bridge—but if you consult the previous link (in Chinese), you’ll learn the name is somewhat misleading. The “cave” is manmade; it’s an old water diversion channel, part of an irrigation system constructed centuries ago. The channel was colonized by bats after it fell out of use—but from what I’ve read the bat colony dispersed in the aftermath of the devastating 921 Earthquake . View Image Details Sundown over a temple complex in the hills of Taiping District, Taichung. View Image Details Downtown Taichung and the huge power plant on the coast are faintly visible in this image captured at Chikanding, an area popular with motorbikers and cyclists. Forging on, the sun broke through the clouds, and crepuscular rays fell from the sky.

Zhongli is home to a surprising number of disused and abandoned cinemas, relics of a lost age of theater in this conurbation of half a million sprawling across the central Taoyuan Plateau 桃園台地 . Decades ago there were nearly two dozen standalone movie theaters in town—but only Zhongyuan Theater 中源大戲院 , one of two in Taiwan still displaying hand-painted movie posters, clings to life as of 2018. Most of the others have been renovated beyond recognition or demolished, but several more are derelict, hard-worn subjects of entropy. Among these relics there are none more alluring than the imposing Dàdōng Theater 大東戲院 (literally the “Great Eastern Theater”), former anchor of Zhongli’s long-vanished Cinema Street 戲院街. View Image Details The brutal exterior of the Great Eastern Theater at dawn. View Image Details Five dead eyes gazing at the street and a poster for V for Vendetta (2005). I chanced upon Dadong Theater while wandering around Zhongli sometime in late 2015. I was in town to search for an apartment—and to get a feel for what would eventually become my winter residence . Straying from the brightly-lit streets of the commercial district west of the train station I soon noticed this fortress-like structure looming over a dark intersection. At that time I had only recently acquired an interest in Taiwanese movie theaters so it seemed like a serendipitous discovery. I resolved to return—and mere weeks later found myself creeping into the dimly-lit lobby, ready to elucidate the mysteries of a movie theater utterly detached from the human world for nearly a decade. View Image Details The dark entrance, light seeping in through the metal shutters. The outlines of a snack bar are barely discernible in the murky gloom. View Image Details Newspaper cutouts, regulations, and Buddhist charms on the back wall of the first projection room. View Image Details A trailer for Batman Begins , released in 2005. View Image Details A total mess on the floor of the first projection room. Business records indicate Dadong Theater was founded in 1956. I harbour some doubts about whether the physical structure of the theater is quite so old—there’s a good chance it was renovated or moved into a newer building in the 1960s or 1970s, but little information exists to corroborate such speculation. What I’ve gleaned from nostalgic threads on Facebook and PTT suggest that Datong Theater was one of several cinemas along this stretch of road at the heart of Zhongli’s old entertainment district 1 . Many Zhongli residents recall the buzz and excitement of seeing Titanic (1997) at Dadong Theater, but it later became a second-run theater (二輪戲院) with discounted tickets in its dying days. View Image Details The theater contains a full set of original projectors staring into the nothingness. This one is marked “bùdòng 不動 ”, or “don’t move”. View Image Details A closer look at the xenon arc lamp inside one of the projectors. I’ve been informed these bulbs are delicate and may explode if handled roughly. View Image Details Inside the ground floor theater, a dank place of mold, dust, and water damage. The approximate date of closure can be determined from the films advertised outside and a calendar found in one of the projection rooms. Both lines of evidence indicate the final showing must have been sometime in the spring of 2006. The building was sealed thereafter—and I have a strong suspicion I may have been the first person to set foot inside since the final curtain call. The access point was a wooden door that had fallen apart after years of exposure to the elements—but it was only open for a brief period of time, and has since been sealed by a metal barrier.

Cholon is a historic Chinatown west of old Saigon in Ho Chi Minh City , Vietnam . I visited the area on three occasions in 2017, intent on wandering around and capturing some pictures from the streets.

Cholon is a historic Chinatown west of old Saigon in Ho Chi Minh City , Vietnam . I visited the area on three occasions in 2017, intent on wandering around and capturing some pictures from the streets. Previously I published an extensive report on the Chinese temples of Cholon , including some detail about the history and demographics of the area, so I won’t repeat myself in this post. Instead, I’ll let the photos do the talking this time around… View Image Details A typical shophouse on the streets of Cholon. I saw many just like this one.

On several recent trips to Ho Chi Minh City I spent some time wandering around Cholon , a vast and historic Chinatown located about five kilometers west of the downtown core of colonial Saigon . Originally settled in the late 17th century by ethnic Chinese settlers, the Hoa People 華人 , it was known by its Cantonese name, Tai-Ngon 堤岸 (literally “Embankment”, but it is also roughly homophonous with “Saigon”). Later the Vietnamese dubbed it Cholon (“Big Market”) after the forerunner of the modern-day Binh Tay Market . The Hoa people were once the majority in Cholon but many fled persecution in the aftermath of Fall/Liberation of Saigon in 1975, and again during the Sino-Vietnamese War . Nowadays the Hoa people only account for approximately 5% of the population of Ho Chi Minh City ( less than half the proportion of ethnic Chinese living in Toronto , my hometown) but their imprint on the streets of Cholon is readily apparent, particularly in the form of the many distinctive temples and guildhalls of the district. View Image Details The Ghost of Impermanence in Tam Son Guildhall. View Image Details Hu Ye with a mouthful of ham at the Quan Am Pagoda. View Image Details Judge Bao presiding in the Ha Chuong Hoi Quan Pagoda. View Image Details Tu Di Gong in an elegant box with many tiger deities. Initially I was interested in visiting Cholon to explore someplace that I might be at least somewhat familiar with. I’ve learned a lot about Chinese folk religion in Taiwan so I was keen to see how these traditions manifested in Vietnam. My curiosity was piqued after reading that Cholon was settled by Chinese people around the same time as Taiwan, albeit with a different mix of migrant groups. Whereas Taiwan was settled primarily by Hoklo (Fujianese) people and a sizeable Hakka minority, Cholon attracted many more Cantonese and Teochew people 1 . As with many overseas Chinese the migrant groups of Cholon organized themselves according to geographic origin and shared language, establishing guildhalls (huìguǎn 會館) to serve the needs of their communities 2 . These guildhalls combined commercial, social, and spiritual functions, acting as business associations, philanthropic organizations, meeting spaces, and halls of worship. Nearly every temple featured in this post began as a guildhall built to serve migrants from specific parts of China. Before we begin I should mention that these temples blend Taoism , Buddhism , and Chinese folk religion without much concern for boundaries. Now for a whirlwind tour of some of the many temples of Cholon… Thien Hau Temple Founded in 1760 by Cantonese immigrants from Guangzhou , the Thien Hau Temple 3 (Vietnamese: Chùa Bà Thiên Hậu ; Chinese: 穗城會館天后廟 4 ) is easily the most famous temple in Cholon, and you’ll regularly witness huge groups of tourists passing through. As with many of the other temples in the area this one venerates Mazu (also known as the Empress of Heaven; Mandarin Chinese: Tiān Hòu 天后), goddess of the sea and protector of seafarers and fisherfolk. Mazu worship is common among pre-modern diasporic Chinese communities—migrants prayed for safe passage through treacherous waters and built temples in her honour after establishing themselves abroad. View Image Details Outside the Thien Hau Temple in Cholon, the most famous of the region’s many historic halls. View Image Details The characters over the entrance to the temple read Suìchéng Huìguǎn 穗城會館 , its official name. “Sui” is a traditional shorthand for Guangzhou. View Image Details Incense coils dangle above the courtyard at Cholon’s most famous Mazu temple. View Image Details Signboards bearing the names of the deities within the temple. View Image Details Pink slips bearing wishes at the Thien Hau Temple. View Image Details Hypnotic incense spirals at the Thien Hau Temple in Cholon. View Image Details Vintage tile at the Thien Hau Temple in Cholon. View Image Details Gorgeous patterns across the temple floor. View Image Details The main shrine at Thien Hau Temple in Cholon. Apparently the wooden carving of Mazu predates the founding of the temple! Tam Son Guildhall Across the street from the Thien Hau Temple is the Tam Son Guildhall (Vietnamese: Hội Quán Tam Sơn; Chinese: 三山會館), built by settlers from Fuzhou in Fujian province, very close to the birthplace of Mazu. Most sources suggest this temple was founded in 1839 but there appears to be some uncertainty about this date. Mazu is worshipped here, as you might expect, but the main shrine venerates Mẹ Sanh (Chinese: Zhùshēng Niángniáng 註生娘娘), a fertility goddess. I was most intrigued by an unfamiliar representation of Tǔ Dì Gōng 土地公 , the god of land, and a shrine to his constant companion, the tiger deity Hǔ Yé 虎爺 . The small shrine on the opposite side of the temple features Chì Tù Mǎ 赤兔馬 , the warhorse belonging to famous general Guān Yǔ 關羽 (also known as Guān Gōng 關公, who appears elsewhere in the same temple), and two idols representing Wú Cháng Guǐ 無常鬼 (literally “Ghost of Impermanence”), an underworld deity charged with administering divine justice 5 . This being’s distinctive headpiece is emblazoned with the phrase Yī Jiàn Fā Cái 一見發財 (“Get Rich at First Sight” and “Become Rich Upon Encountering Me” are two translations I’ve seen around the web) and supplicants pray to this god for luck and prosperity. View Image Details The modest Tam Son Guildhall from the street. View Image Details Tu Di Gong, the Land God, on the left side of Tam Son Guildhall. View Image Details Tiger shrine inside Tam Son Guildhall. View Image Details Praying to the tiger gods. View Image Details The altar on the right side of the temple features an assortment of deities. Quan Am Pagoda Quan Am Pagoda (Vietnamese: Chùa Quan Âm ; Chinese: 堤岸觀音廟) is another famous temple in Cholon regularly frequented by tour groups. Officially known as 溫陵會館 (Vietnamese: Hội Quán Ôn Lăng ), this guildhall traces its history back to 1740 6 and derives its name from a traditional term for Quanzhou , a historic port in Fujian. This particular temple has much more of a Buddhist focus than the others, and the primary object of worship in this temple is Guān Yīn , a Bodhisattva commonly known as the Goddess of Mercy in English 7 . An altar featuring three figures Sān Bǎo Fó 三寶佛 ) surrounded by the Eighteen Arhats 十八羅漢 also caught my eye as I wandered through. This holy trinity almost certainly includes Amitābha 阿弥陀佛 but the others are unknown to me. Finally, I was intrigued to find another small shrine to Hu Ye, the tiger god, and something I hadn’t seen before: a mythical chimera known as Pí Xiū 貔貅 ( 中文 ), which comes in male and female forms distinguished by the number of horns (one for male and two for female). View Image Details The half-moon pond in front of the Quan Am Pagoda. View Image Details A closer look at the ceramic ornamentation on the outside of the Quan Am Pagoda in Cholon.

View Image Details Shrine to the Three Jewels and the Eighteen Arhats on the left-hand side of the Quan Am Pagoda. View Image Details Raising an incense coil at the Quan Am Pagoda. View Image Details Another shrine to the tiger god—but this time Hu Ye is joined by Pi Xiu! Phuoc An Guildhall Phuoc An Guildhall (Vietnamese: Hội Quán Phước An; Chinese: 福安會館) is less of a mystery than the others; this hall was constructed in 1902 to serve the immigrant community from Fu’an in northeast Fujian. The primary deity worshipped here is the red-faced general Guan Yu (hence the Chinese name, Guān Dì Temple 關帝廟, “Emperor Guan”), but you’ll also find many others deities including Sūn Wù Kōng 孫悟空 (represented here as Tề Thiên Đại Thánh 齊天大聖), the Monkey King from the 16th century Chinese classic Journey to the West . I was most impressed with the beautiful ceramic murals inside this particular temple; this art form, jiǎn nián 剪黏 (“cut and paste”), is more often seen on temple exteriors. Even the traditional tripodal censer is covered with fragments of porcelain ! The stone guardian lions out front also seemed quite unconventional. View Image Details A colourful stone guardian lion by the entrance. View Image Details Sun Wu Kong, the Monkey King! View Image Details More vintage floor tiles at the Phuoc An Guildhall. View Image Details An eye-catching ceramic mural of a dragon. View Image Details Candlelight glimmering off a traditional tripodal censer covered with unusual ceramic decorations. View Image Details An unusual blue figure in front of Phuoc An Guildhall. View Image Details Horse and groom at Nghia An Guildhall. Nghia An Guildhall Nghia An Guildhall (Vietnamese: Hội Quán Nghĩa An or Chùa Ông; Chinese: 義安會館 ) dates back to 1819 and was built by people from Chaozhou (also known as Teochew). As with several of the other guildhalls profiled here this one derives its name from a very old term for Chaozhou, one that dates back to the 5th century in this case. This particular temple is known for its gorgeous woodcarvings . As with the previous temple this one is dedicated to Guan Yu, not only a god of war but also trade and commerce. View Image Details A traditional stone lion guards the entrance to the Nghia An Guildhall. View Image Details The entrance to an ornate temple that looks almost new. View Image Details Looking up at the beautiful woodwork inside the guildhall. View Image Details Guan Gong enshrined at the main altar inside Nghia An Guildhall. Ha Chuong Guildhall Founded in 1809, Ha Chuong Guildhall (Vietnamese: Hội Quán Hà Chương ; Chinese: 霞漳會館) is closest in appearance to the southern Fujian style of temples seen across much of Taiwan. The formal name of this guildhall derives from an ancient term for Zhangzhou in southern Fujian. This is also primarily a Mazu temple but there’s quite an assortment of other shrines to be seen—as well as a deity I’ve not noticed before, a dark-faced judge with a crescent moon on his forehead, Bāo Zhěng 包拯 (appearing here as Lord Bao 包公). Chéng Huáng 城隍 , the City God, also makes an appearance, as does Tài Suì 太歲 , a personification of Chinese astrology . View Image Details Exterior shot of Ha Chuong Guildhall.

View Image Details Hu Ye and Pi Xiu shrine at Ha Chuong Guildhall. View Image Details Tai Sui, Judge Bao, and the City God meting out divine justice in the Ha Chuong Guildhall. Quynh Phu Guildhall Quynh Phu Guildhall (Vietnamese: Hội Quán Quỳnh Phủ or Chùa Bà Hải Nam; Chinese: 瓊府會館 or 海南天后廟) was founded sometime around 1824 to serve the needs of immigrants from Hainan , an island in the far south of China not far from Vietnam. The formal name of this guildhall is derived from the archaic name for Hainan. As with several of the others this temple also reveres Mazu, but it doesn’t look much like the others. The colour scheme is much brighter and more vibrant, the woodcarvings more personable. View Image Details In the courtyard of the colourful Quynh Phu Guildhall. View Image Details A closer look at some of the woodcarvings and tablets overhanging the entrance to the main hall. View Image Details Perusing the interior of the Quynh Phu Guildhall. View Image Details Mazu is the dark-faced goddess on the main altar. View Image Details A rather charming manifestation of Tu Di Gong, the god of land, inside Quynh Phu Guildhall. Le Chau Guildhall Le Chau Guildhall (Vietnamese: Hội Quán Lệ Châu ; Chinese: 麗朱會館) was founded in 1896 to honour the master goldsmiths, silversmiths, and jewellers who introduced the lucrative trade to southern Vietnam. Since this guildhall was built by and for tradespeople rather than an immigrant community the name alludes to the trade itself, meaning something along the lines of “beautiful jewel”. On the inside, the altars are also different from the others, in that they feature only tablets with characters drawn in gold calligraphy. View Image Details Outside the rather modest Le Chau Guildhall in Cholon. View Image Details The main altar reads Zǔ Shī 祖師 (“Patriarch” or “Great Master”). Ong Bon Pagoda Finally we arrive at what is popularly known as the Ong Bon Pagoda (Chùa Ông Bổn), an outlier from the others for several reasons. This is the oldest temple on the list, dating back to 1730, and also the only one built to serve two migrant communities—from Quanzhou and Zhangzhou. This explains the formal name of the underlying guildhall, 二府會館 (Vietnamese: Miếu Nhị Phủ 8 ), which translates to “Two Prefecture Guildhall”. Enshrined here is Tu Di Gong , the god of land, known to Vietnamese as Ong Bon. English language sources refer to Ong Bon as the god of “wealth and happiness” but in Taiwan we usually think of the god of land as a protective deity, warding off evil and ensuring the health and welfare of the local populace with the assistance of Hu Ye, his divine tiger steed. View Image Details Ong Bon Pagoda, the oldest of the lot. The characters on either side translate to Fujian Two Prefectures Guildhall.

Hopefully this has been an informative introduction to Chinese temple culture in Cholon, Ho Chi Minh City’s historic Chinatown . This post is by no means comprehensive, but it comes close to covering all the traditional Chinese temples and guildhalls around Cholon 9 . That being said, I’m still learning about Chinese folk religion so I may have made some mistakes in the text—please feel free to let me know in the comments or by sending an email. Cholon was originally settled by ethnic Chinese fleeing the collapse of the Ming dynasty prior to Vietnamese conquest of the Mekong Delta . These people became known as the Minh Hương (initially 明香 and later 明鄉). ↩ Guildhalls and similar organizations are common throughout the Chinese diaspora. In North America they were often called benevolent associations. In much of the rest of Southeast Asia it seems like the term kongsi 公司 (literally “company”) was more common. I’m not very familiar with these organizations as they don’t often come up in my research into Taiwanese history, possibly because Han Taiwanese became the majority not long after settling the country. Previously I wrote about a Chinese association founded in Taitung during the Japanese colonial era but that’s an unusual case. Japanese colonization subsumed many regional identities into a generalized Hoklo majority, particularly in the case of Taiwanese Teochew, who I wrote about here . ↩ Every temple has an official name in Chinese—but what we think of as “Chinese” is really hundreds of languages , most of which have no standard romanization system. All of these temples also have Vietnamese names, but some of them translate the name of the guildhall whereas others represent the main deity worshipped in the temple. English names in common usage usually derive from Vietnamese so any mistakes or inaccuracies are multiplied. I’ve been a bit loose in using the names of individual guildhalls but the alternative is calling almost everything a “Hoi Quan Pagoda”, which is less than ideal. ↩ Officially this is a guildhall named 穗城會館; the first character is a traditional shorthand for Guangzhou followed by the character for “city”. ↩ In Taiwan this deity is almost always two gods, Qī Yé 七爺 (Seventh Lord) and Bā Yé 八爺 (Eighth Lord), one tall and white and the other short and black. ↩ Most English language sources say the temple was founded in the “19th century”. Here I am going with the date mentioned in the Vietnamese Wikipedia entry. In Chinese folk religious tradition the temple is the organization, not the structure, so we’re mostly concerned with when the guildhall itself was founded, not when the physical form of the temple was constructed. It is very likely that every temple featured in this post was renovated sometime in the last several decades—and those renovations can ↩ If you’re paying close attention you’ll probably realize that Quan Am is Vietnamese for Guan Yin. Here she is depicted in Chinese folk style with a special flask (jìngpíng 淨瓶, “pure bottle” perhaps) in her left hand, purportedly containing the elixir of life or holy water. ↩ A direct translation of the Chinese name would be Hội Quán Nhị Phủ; the “Mieu” in the name means “temple”, not guildhall, and results from a somewhat garbled translation of 二府廟. ↩ Two more leads on temples not covered in this post: Nghia Nhuan Guildhall (Vietnamese: Hội Quán Nghĩa Nhuận; Chinese: 義潤會館) founded in 1872; and Minh Huong Temple (Vietnamese: Đình Minh Hương Gia Thạnh; Chinese: 明鄉嘉盛會館), founded by Ming dynasty loyalists in 1797, and only open to the public before noon. ↩

Ong Bon Pagoda Finally we arrive at what is popularly known as the Ong Bon Pagoda (Chùa Ông Bổn), an outlier from the others for several reasons. This is the oldest temple on the list, dating back to 1730, and also the only one built to serve two migrant communities—from Quanzhou and Zhangzhou. This explains the formal name of the underlying guildhall, 二府會館 (Vietnamese: Miếu Nhị Phủ 8 ), which translates to “Two Prefecture Guildhall”. Enshrined here is Tu Di Gong , the god of land, known to Vietnamese as Ong Bon. English language sources refer to Ong Bon as the god of “wealth and happiness” but in Taiwan we usually think of the god of land as a protective deity, warding off evil and ensuring the health and welfare of the local populace with the assistance of Hu Ye, his divine tiger steed.

Hopefully this has been an informative introduction to Chinese temple culture in Cholon, Ho Chi Minh City’s historic Chinatown . This post is by no means comprehensive, but it comes close to covering all the traditional Chinese temples and guildhalls around Cholon 9 . That being said, I’m still learning about Chinese folk religion so I may have made some mistakes in the text—please feel free to let me know in the comments or by sending an email. Cholon was originally settled by ethnic Chinese fleeing the collapse of the Ming dynasty prior to Vietnamese conquest of the Mekong Delta . These people became known as the Minh Hương (initially 明香 and later 明鄉). ↩ Guildhalls and similar organizations are common throughout the Chinese diaspora. In North America they were often called benevolent associations. In much of the rest of Southeast Asia it seems like the term kongsi 公司 (literally “company”) was more common. I’m not very familiar with these organizations as they don’t often come up in my research into Taiwanese history, possibly because Han Taiwanese became the majority not long after settling the country. Previously I wrote about a Chinese association founded in Taitung during the Japanese colonial era but that’s an unusual case. Japanese colonization subsumed many regional identities into a generalized Hoklo majority, particularly in the case of Taiwanese Teochew, who I wrote about here . ↩ Every temple has an official name in Chinese—but what we think of as “Chinese” is really hundreds of languages , most of which have no standard romanization system. All of these temples also have Vietnamese names, but some of them translate the name of the guildhall whereas others represent the main deity worshipped in the temple. English names in common usage usually derive from Vietnamese so any mistakes or inaccuracies are multiplied. I’ve been a bit loose in using the names of individual guildhalls but the alternative is calling almost everything a “Hoi Quan Pagoda”, which is less than ideal. ↩ Officially this is a guildhall named 穗城會館; the first character is a traditional shorthand for Guangzhou followed by the character for “city”. ↩ In Taiwan this deity is almost always two gods, Qī Yé 七爺 (Seventh Lord) and Bā Yé 八爺 (Eighth Lord), one tall and white and the other short and black. ↩ Most English language sources say the temple was founded in the “19th century”. Here I am going with the date mentioned in the Vietnamese Wikipedia entry. In Chinese folk religious tradition the temple is the organization, not the structure, so we’re mostly concerned with when the guildhall itself was founded, not when the physical form of the temple was constructed. It is very likely that every temple featured in this post was renovated sometime in the last several decades—and those renovations can ↩ If you’re paying close attention you’ll probably realize that Quan Am is Vietnamese for Guan Yin. Here she is depicted in Chinese folk style with a special flask (jìngpíng 淨瓶, “pure bottle” perhaps) in her left hand, purportedly containing the elixir of life or holy water. ↩ A direct translation of the Chinese name would be Hội Quán Nhị Phủ; the “Mieu” in the name means “temple”, not guildhall, and results from a somewhat garbled translation of 二府廟. ↩ Two more leads on temples not covered in this post: Nghia Nhuan Guildhall (Vietnamese: Hội Quán Nghĩa Nhuận; Chinese: 義潤會館) founded in 1872; and Minh Huong Temple (Vietnamese: Đình Minh Hương Gia Thạnh; Chinese: 明鄉嘉盛會館), founded by Ming dynasty loyalists in 1797, and only open to the public before noon. ↩

Wǔzhōu Theater (五洲戲院) is the last remnant of cinema in Chishang , Taitung , a picturesque town located in the fertile Huadong Valley of Taiwan .

Puli was my home base for several days of road tripping and adventure around Nantou in October 2015. Recently I decided to publish my findings and impressions from this trip despite not knowing much about what I was seeing at that time. Most of the other posts in this series document trips from one place to another but in this post I’m focusing on some of what I found within city limits, starting with some history to put everything in context. For much of the 19th century Puli was known as Po-sia 埔社 or Po-li-sia 埔裏社. Both of these Hokkien names derive from now-extinct languages formerly spoken by the Taiwanese Plains Indigenous people 平埔族群 of the western coast, likely Pazeh 巴宰語 or Babuza 巴布薩語 . Plains Indigenous people migrated to Puli Basin 埔里盆地 in large numbers to escape Chinese aggression in the late 17th century, an episode briefly mentioned in the first part of this series, and paid tribute to the Atayal and Bunun people already living in the region. View Image Details Lanterns decorate the entrance to a Mazu Temple in Puli. This is about as far from the sea as you can get in Taiwan. Puli was quarantined for much of the Qing dynasty era ; subjects of the Chinese emperor were forbidden passage into the interior and trade with its inhabitants 1 , although this did not stop occasional incursions by the burgeoning settler population of the island 2 . Chinese settlement began in earnest in the 1850s, with Christian missionaries visiting the basin shortly thereafter 3 . In 1875 the Qing authorities adopted a policy of Kāishān Fǔfān 開山撫番 (literally “open the mountains and pacify the savages”), largely in response to the Rover and Mudan incidents, which exacerbated fears of foreign intervention in those parts of Taiwan that the Qing had heretofore expressed no particular interest in governing. Thus Puli was incorporated into Qing-administered Taiwan and the basin was officially opened to Chinese settlement. In 1877 work began on Polisia Walled City 埔里社廳城 (also known as Dàpù City 大埔城), a gated enclave surrounded by a thorny bamboo palisade and a system of moats. But, as with many other efforts to more actively govern and develop Taiwan, this one was cut short by the Japanese invasion in 1895 . The gated enclosure was completely destroyed by 1914, part of an island-wide urban redevelopment campaign, but traces of it remain in the naming of streets and administrative divisions around central Puli 4 . View Image Details This monument officially marks the Geographic Center of Taiwan . It was also once the site of a Shinto shrine in Japanese times. Puli was once home to three Shinto shrines : two shrines at Hǔtóushān 虎頭山, on the northeast side of town, and a third one 5 next to the old sugar factory . Nōkō Shrine 能高社 was built on Hǔtóushān 虎頭山 in 1925 and is now part of a public park and monument, the Geographic Center of Taiwan 台灣地理中心 . In 1940, not long after the introduction of the Kōminka Movement 皇民化運動 (a policy of accelerated assimilation and Japanization), another much larger and more elaborate Shinto shrine with almost the same name (能高神社) was constructed at the base of the mountain on what is now the running track for a vocational high school. Apart from the broad stairway leading up the mountainside hardly any trace remains of either shrine. View Image Details Stone lanterns line a stairway leading to Xingling Temple. This is the main entrance to Puli and—if you look closely—you’ll see a monument to the Battle of Wuniulan by the roadside. Head due west from Hutuoshan to the other side of town and you’ll find Àilán Village 愛蘭里, one of the earliest Chinese settlements in Puli Basin. Historically this area was known as Wūniúlán 烏牛欄, typically romanized as Ougulan in 19th century English language accounts. This settlement curls around the northwestern side of a modest hill guarding the main entrance to Puli proper, site of the Battle of Wuniulan 烏牛欄之役 , the last major conflict of the February 28 Massacre 二二八事件 in 1947. At that time an impressive suspension bridge 6 spanned the river but nowadays an unremarkable concrete structure facilitates passage into the city. View Image Details In front of the historic Xingling Temple in Puli. View Image Details Vintage style inside the office at Xingling Temple. Founded in 1901, Xǐnglíng Temple 醒靈寺 is a historic temple perched on the hill overlooking the entrance to Puli. I stopped here to take some photos since it was obviously a local attraction—but with such a dizzying variety of lions and lanterns I did not manage to locate any of those salvaged from the destruction of the Shinto shrines on the opposite side of town. From what I’ve read this temple also has a pair of guardian lions dating back to the Qing dynasty era but I wasn’t able to verify whether those lions guard the entrance to the temple, or if they’re located somewhere else. View Image Details Huaguo Theater can still be identified by the broken sign jutting out into the street. View Image Details The main screen inside the abandoned and overgrown Huaguo Theater. This visit to Puli coincided with a growing interest in documenting the legacy of the Taiwanese cinema industry , a project that has since become one of the focal points of my studies in Taiwan. After exploring Datong Theater earlier that same year I became interested in predicting where more theaters might be found. I hypothesized that you might find one theater for every 25,000 residents or so, which turned out to be an underestimate in the case of Puli, which was once home to something like seven or eight movie theaters. Only three remain—and Huáguó Theater 華國戲院 , the most photogenic of the lot, is already the subject of a full-length post with plenty of photographs . View Image Details An old entertainment complex, home of Shānmíng Theater 山明戲院 , the very last cinema operating in Puli. View Image Details Vintage tiling on the streets of Puli. View Image Details Xikang Road street scene. Hard to believe this used to be a bustling entertainment district! Notice the shelves still affixed to the wall of the building? Next up: a brief inspection of Yínghǎi City God Temple 瀛海城隍廟 , allegedly the oldest temple in Puli. I stopped for a look after noticing red cloth wrapped around the stone guardian lions out front. Naturally I was quite curious about the use of red cloth in this temple, which was evidently undergoing a massive reconstruction project. Some research revealed that the statues, censer, and other religious artifacts covered with cloth will be unwrapped during a ritual known as kāiguāng 開光 , literally “open to light”, and until then are wèikāiguāng 未開光, or not open to light. The doors of the temple were open so I went inside to take a look—and found all of the gods gathered into a cramped space behind towering stone columns still wrapped in plastic from the factory. Behind a curtain I caught a glimpse of some impressive woodwork surrounding an altar that hadn’t yet been finished 7 . View Image Details A stone lion at the Puli City God Temple remains blindfolded until renovations are complete. View Image Details Horse-Face in puppet form. View Image Details Here I was reminded of a meme. View Image Details The grim visage of Ba Ye, one of the guardians of the underworld. I am fascinated by the history and lore of the City God but won’t go into great depth in this post as I’d rather save my commentary for a temple for which I have better photos. But I will mention that these temples are organized along bureaucratic lines, much as you would find in any city, with divisions overseeing various matters of import to underworld affairs. I’ve included pictures of two members of this bureaucracy: Horse-Face 馬面 and Bā Yé 八爺 , one of the Eight Generals 八家將 , both charged with escorting dead souls into the underworld for judgement, rounding up ghosts and spirits, and otherwise enforcing supernatural justice. View Image Details Steel rods extend from a rough concrete party wall , the naked interface between cells in the body of the city. That’s all for this post about a brief, uninformed stay in Puli in 2015. This series will continue with photos and commentary from a trip to Sun Moon Lake, one of Taiwan’s most popular attractions. If you’re interested in reading more about Puli’s pre-Qing history I suggest perusing these English language travelogues available from the Reed Institute’s online library : T.L. Bullock , J.B. Steere , and H.J. Allen , all published in the 1870s. ↩ This quarantine was violated many times, as was often the case along the nearly lawless frontiers of Taiwan. One of the more significant transgressions, the Guō Bǎinián Incident 郭百年事件 , began in 1814 with the arrival of around a thousand Chinese settlers in Puli Basin. They founded their own village but soon massacred many of the Indigenous people already residing there. Word got back to the Qing authorities and they soon intervened, recalling the settlers and punishing the leader of the expedition. The Taipei Times has an informative article about this element of local history. ↩ The oldest church in the region is probably the Àilán Presbyterian Church 愛蘭基督長老教會 , which traces its history back to 1865. ↩ Additional reshaping of the urban landscape occurred following a series of earthquakes that struck in 1916 and 1917 . From what I’ve read modern Puli closely follows the plan laid down in the aftermath of these disasters. ↩ Not much is written about the shrine next to the old sugar factory but it was known as Horisha Shrine 埔裏社, which is the old Hokkien name for Puli transliterated into Japanese. I don’t think anything remains of the original shrine but in the last couple years a Japanese-themed restaurant has opened on the site and a picturesque wooden torii has been erected, obviously paying tribute to this lost history. I haven’t visited it yet but you can find it on Gōngchéng Road 公誠路 just across from the entrance to the derelict sugar factory on the northwest side of the downtown core. ↩ Only the nameplate for Wuniulan Suspension Bridge 烏牛欄吊橋 remains—and recently it was damaged by the installation of a tacky signboard welcoming people to Puli, yet another story of official disregard for historical assets in Taiwan. ↩ Oddly enough this temple looked to be in the same state when I swung through in 2017. Apparently this temple was damaged beyond repair in the devastating 921 Earthquake in 1999. I find it surprising that such a historic and important temple wasn’t able to raise sufficient funds to complete the project in the intervening years—so I suspect there’s a much more complicated version of this story to tell some day. ↩

At that time an impressive suspension bridge 6 spanned the river but nowadays an unremarkable concrete structure facilitates passage into the city.

Founded in 1901, Xǐnglíng Temple 醒靈寺 is a historic temple perched on the hill overlooking the entrance to Puli. I stopped here to take some photos since it was obviously a local attraction—but with such a dizzying variety of lions and lanterns I did not manage to locate any of those salvaged from the destruction of the Shinto shrines on the opposite side of town. From what I’ve read this temple also has a pair of guardian lions dating back to the Qing dynasty era but I wasn’t able to verify whether those lions guard the entrance to the temple, or if they’re located somewhere else.

This visit to Puli coincided with a growing interest in documenting the legacy of the Taiwanese cinema industry , a project that has since become one of the focal points of my studies in Taiwan. After exploring Datong Theater earlier that same year I became interested in predicting where more theaters might be found. I hypothesized that you might find one theater for every 25,000 residents or so, which turned out to be an underestimate in the case of Puli, which was once home to something like seven or eight movie theaters. Only three remain—and Huáguó Theater 華國戲院 , the most photogenic of the lot, is already the subject of a full-length post with plenty of photographs .

Next up: a brief inspection of Yínghǎi City God Temple 瀛海城隍廟 , allegedly the oldest temple in Puli. I stopped for a look after noticing red cloth wrapped around the stone guardian lions out front. Naturally I was quite curious about the use of red cloth in this temple, which was evidently undergoing a massive reconstruction project. Some research revealed that the statues, censer, and other religious artifacts covered with cloth will be unwrapped during a ritual known as kāiguāng 開光 , literally “open to light”, and until then are wèikāiguāng 未開光, or not open to light. The doors of the temple were open so I went inside to take a look—and found all of the gods gathered into a cramped space behind towering stone columns still wrapped in plastic from the factory. Behind a curtain I caught a glimpse of some impressive woodwork surrounding an altar that hadn’t yet been finished 7 .

I am fascinated by the history and lore of the City God but won’t go into great depth in this post as I’d rather save my commentary for a temple for which I have better photos. But I will mention that these temples are organized along bureaucratic lines, much as you would find in any city, with divisions overseeing various matters of import to underworld affairs. I’ve included pictures of two members of this bureaucracy: Horse-Face 馬面 and Bā Yé 八爺 , one of the Eight Generals 八家將 , both charged with escorting dead souls into the underworld for judgement, rounding up ghosts and spirits, and otherwise enforcing supernatural justice. View Image Details Steel rods extend from a rough concrete party wall , the naked interface between cells in the body of the city. That’s all for this post about a brief, uninformed stay in Puli in 2015. This series will continue with photos and commentary from a trip to Sun Moon Lake, one of Taiwan’s most popular attractions. If you’re interested in reading more about Puli’s pre-Qing history I suggest perusing these English language travelogues available from the Reed Institute’s online library : T.L. Bullock , J.B. Steere , and H.J. Allen , all published in the 1870s. ↩ This quarantine was violated many times, as was often the case along the nearly lawless frontiers of Taiwan. One of the more significant transgressions, the Guō Bǎinián Incident 郭百年事件 , began in 1814 with the arrival of around a thousand Chinese settlers in Puli Basin. They founded their own village but soon massacred many of the Indigenous people already residing there. Word got back to the Qing authorities and they soon intervened, recalling the settlers and punishing the leader of the expedition. The Taipei Times has an informative article about this element of local history. ↩ The oldest church in the region is probably the Àilán Presbyterian Church 愛蘭基督長老教會 , which traces its history back to 1865. ↩ Additional reshaping of the urban landscape occurred following a series of earthquakes that struck in 1916 and 1917 . From what I’ve read modern Puli closely follows the plan laid down in the aftermath of these disasters. ↩ Not much is written about the shrine next to the old sugar factory but it was known as Horisha Shrine 埔裏社, which is the old Hokkien name for Puli transliterated into Japanese. I don’t think anything remains of the original shrine but in the last couple years a Japanese-themed restaurant has opened on the site and a picturesque wooden torii has been erected, obviously paying tribute to this lost history. I haven’t visited it yet but you can find it on Gōngchéng Road 公誠路 just across from the entrance to the derelict sugar factory on the northwest side of the downtown core. ↩ Only the nameplate for Wuniulan Suspension Bridge 烏牛欄吊橋 remains—and recently it was damaged by the installation of a tacky signboard welcoming people to Puli, yet another story of official disregard for historical assets in Taiwan. ↩ Oddly enough this temple looked to be in the same state when I swung through in 2017. Apparently this temple was damaged beyond repair in the devastating 921 Earthquake in 1999. I find it surprising that such a historic and important temple wasn’t able to raise sufficient funds to complete the project in the intervening years—so I suspect there’s a much more complicated version of this story to tell some day. ↩

My second day on the road in Nantou County in October 2015 was completely unplanned. I left Puli and headed deeper into the mountains simply to see what was there, not having done any advance research. From a glance at the map I had a rough idea where I’d be going—deeper into traditional Taiwanese Indigenous lands to the east of Puli Basin (埔里盆地). Ultimately I ended up visiting several settlements and two reservoirs in a few hours of riding around what is now known as the township of Ren'ai . Ren’ai Township is entirely beyond the former Tuniu Boundary Line ( 土牛界線 ), a porous frontier dividing Han Chinese lands from Indigenous territory in Qing dynasty era Taiwan 1 . At its greatest extent in 1875 this boundary encompassed Puli and neighboring Yuchi , home to Sun Moon Lake (日月潭). Imperial Japan, after conquering the lowlands in 1895 , embarked upon a long and often violent mission to assimilate the high mountain people over the course of the next half century. The colonial authorities were intent on exploiting the natural resources of the interior—primarily camphor and lumber, but also certain minerals—and legitimizing Japan as a “civilizing” power on par with the nations of Europe. Despite this, what is now Ren’ai Township was administered as the fāndì (蕃地, literally “savage land”) of Nōkō County ( 能高郡 ) until control was relinquished in 1945. Only in 1950 was Ren’ai given its present name, one of several common terms derived from the ideology of the ruling KMT party 2 . After departing from Puli I headed southeast along Wǔjiè Road (武界路, also known as 投71鄉道), driving through mushrooms farms and betel nut plantations on the way to the mountains. Puli Basin bottoms out at approximately 500 meters above sea level so it’s quite a climb to where the old road slips over a pass at 1,300 meters elevation. Since 2006 there is a shortcut: the kilometer-long Zhuōshè Tunnel (卓社隧道), punched through the mountain at roughly 1,000 meters. The interior is quite damp, a consequence of considerable groundwater seepage , which makes for a slick ride through the dimly-lit passage to Ren’ai Township. View Image Details Average roadside vista on the way out of Puli Basin: betel nut trees everywhere. View Image Details Punching through the mountainside. View Image Details Many travellers have left their mark on the tunnel walls. View Image Details Descending Into Wujie Village and the Zhoushui River Valley. This is the view after passing through the Zhoushe Tunnel. View Image Details Now entering Bunun tribal lands. The view from the other side of the tunnel is spectacular. After a sharp descent along twisting mountain roads I passed through a stone slab gateway 3 and arrived at the home of the Wǔjiè Indigenous community ( 武界部落 ) of the Bunun people (布農族). In official terms this is Fǎzhì Village (法治村) but Buqaiz is the traditional name for this place in the Takituduh dialect of the Bunun language . From what I’ve read this community was forcibly resettled here from the mountains to the south in 1919 4 . Additional information about Boqaiv can be found in English here and in Chinese here , here , here , here , and here . View Image Details The recently restored Wujie Suspension Bridge ( 武界吊橋 ). Buqaiz sprawls across the Zhuóshuǐ River (濁水溪), the longest in Taiwan, which meanders south through the mountains before turning due west toward the sea. The Zhoushui River divides Changhua from Yunlin and has traditionally been an informal boundary between northern and southern Taiwan. Here in the high mountains it is a sluggish, silty stream, from which the name—which means “muddy” or “turbid” water—is derived. This high sediment load is a result of the many landslides that occur in the highlands, particularly after earthquakes and typhoons. Extreme rainfall events can wash an incredible amount of material into the river, something you’ll see direct evidence of in the photos to come. View Image Details The view across the suspension bridge. Nowadays it is only for tourists and foot traffic. Wujie is also home to a historic dam and reservoir of the same name, both part of the much larger Sun Moon Lake Hydroelectric Project ( 日月潭水力電氣工事 ). Construction began in 1919 but came to a halt a few years later due to the global post-war recession. Work resumed in 1927 and what is now known as the Dàguān Power Plant ( 大觀發電廠 ) began generating power in late 1934. Wujie Dam (武界壩), located approximately 20 kilometers from Daguan, diverts the flow of Zhoushui River through a 15 kilometer-long tunnel (武界引水隧道) to Sun Moon Lake, raising the water level by about 20 meters and increasing capacity sixfold. This complex system, one of the world’s most elaborate hydroelectric projects of its time, was designed to ensure a constant supply of water to downstream generating station. In the many decades since it was built this system has been continually improved and expanded . View Image Details The view from just inside Wujie Reservoir. The old colonial dam is obscured on the right; a more modern dam can be seen on the left. What makes the waters of the reservoir such a vibrant shade of turquoise? I suppose I wasn’t that surprised when I first observed this phenomenon at Wujie—after all, aren’t mountain lakes often this bright? In temperate and alpine areas this effect is commonly caused by rock flour deposited by glaciers but Taiwan, even with its many high mountains, does not appear to have experienced much glaciation in recent eras. That being said, the mechanism is probably the same : sediment suspended in the water column absorbs certain frequencies of light to produce a milky or turquoise appearance. Not just any sediment will do—it needs to be of the right particle size and chemistry—but apparently the conditions are met here in the mountains of Nantou, which are primarily made of uplifted sedimentary rock. View Image Details Looking north from the eastern side of Wujie Reservoir. This image is real; the water really is that shade of turquoise! Heading north along the reservoir I soon entered the northernmost settlement of Bunun people, a place known in the Takituduh dialect as Sima-un and in Chinese as Wànfēng Village (萬豐村), home of the Qūbīng Indigenous community (曲冰部落) 5 . This community was famously involved in the Zǐmèiyuán Incident (姊妹原事件) in 1903, an event dramatized in the Taiwanese cinematic epic Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale . In short, the Japanese persuaded the Qubing to ambush a large party of Seediq people from the Tgdaya group (克達雅) who were lured downriver under false pretences. After a feast and celebratory drinking the Bunun slaughtered approximately a hundred Seediq, greatly inhibiting their ability to resist Japanese advances into the highlands. This massacre occurred not far from where Wujie Dam was built several decades later. View Image Details A convenience store on the outskirts of Sima-un, the northernmost Bunun settlement. View Image Details An abandoned house in Sima-un. It looks Japanese but this settlement only dates back to 1949. View Image Details This brick house has a nameplate over the door, much like you’ll find on other homes in rural Taiwan. The difference is the lettering—it’s a local Bunun name written with the Latin alphabet, not Chinese characters. In 1922 the Qubing were forced out of the mountains and settled at a place named Ququaz, or Gēgēyuán (哥哥原) in Chinese, on the east side of the Zhoushui River. The completion of Wujie Dam and the accumulation of silt over the years caused the community to relocate twice more , making Sima-un their third home in the area. View Image Details Not much to see at this famous archaeological site, the first in the high mountain area of Taiwan. Just north of Wanfeng Village one will pass the Qubing Ruins ( 曲冰遺址 ), an archaeological site excavated by Chén Zhòngyù (陳仲玉) from 1981–1987. His team found an entire village with dozens of homes, nearly two hundred stone sarcophagi, and tens of thousands of artifacts, many showing evidence of extensive trade across the region. It was a significant discovery—the first of its kind in the mountainous interior of Taiwan—and, with signs of human habitation going back as far as 3,500 years before present, it also ended the debate about whether Taiwanese Indigenous people had settled the mountains prior to the arrival of Han Chinese settlers in the 1600s 6 . I had no idea about any of this when I swung by so I only snapped one quick photograph without examining the site too closely. There probably wouldn’t have been much to see anyway; the site appears to be completely overgrown despite its status as a third-class national monument. View Image Details Massive deposits of silt choke this bend in the river north of the reservoir. The small settlement in the distance is Pulan, home of the Songlin community. I continued north, exiting Bunun territory, and soon arrived in Pulan, home of the Sōnglín Indigenous community (松林部落). A century ago this was Seediq territory but a group of closely-related Truku people (太魯閣族) from the highest reaches of the Zhoushui River were relocated here in the immediate aftermath of the Musha Incident (霧社事件) in 1930. This village moved several times, much like the others already described in this post, before settling in its current location in 1950 7 . Knowing none of this I drove around the back of the village and stopped for lunch at a small eatery with a picnic table out front. Turns out the boss was Han Taiwanese who had married into the community so it was standard Taiwanese fare—steamed dumplings, if I recall correctly. I enjoyed making smalltalk with some curious locals while dining before hitting the road again. View Image Details Another abandoned wooden home, this time in Pulan, a Truku settlement.

The power plant entered into service in 1943 but the dam and reservoir were not completed until 1957. This reservoir also has a major siltation problem but this only becomes obvious at the far end. From the viewpoint at the deepest end of the reservoir it seems absolutely idyllic. View Image Details Clouds casting shadows over the far side of the reservoir. View Image Details Sundown over Wanda Reservoir from an elevated vantage point in Wushe. I spent the last hour or so riding around places I’ve already seen on previous trips, particularly this crossing of the Central Mountain Range in 2014, so I didn’t take many photos. Once you get anywhere near Qīngjìng Farm (清境農場) the many coach buses that ply these mountain roads become so hazardous that stopping to take a quick picture becomes much less appealing. I ended up making the journey back to Puli at dusk, impressed with what I had seen on this random ride through the mountains of Ren’ai. View Image Details Mountainside farms on steep slopes somewhere near Qingjing. View Image Details Tour buses in the parking lot of the rest stop at Qingjing. If you haven’t already read the first part in this series I suggest you do so. The next post in this series details some of what you’ll see in Puli itself and will conclude with posts about Sun Moon Lake and Xinyi Township. Hopefully you’ve found this informative—it ended up being much more work than I had expected given the paucity of English language writing about this remote region of Taiwan. Many thanks to Andrew Kerslake for reviewing this post! Subjects of the Qing emperor were forbidden to cross into “savage lands” but the Taiwanese interior was virtually lawless in those days. Informal trade, intermarriage, and violence occurred all along the frontier, not unlike what we imagine of the heavily mythologized American Wild West . For more about this subject I strongly recommend picking up a copy of Outcasts of Empire: Japan’s Rule on Taiwan’s “Savage Border,” 1874-1945 by Paul D. Barclay, available here . For a brief overview check out this review by Michael Turton . Also worth noting: despite a century of population changes Ren’ai Township remains approximately 80% Indigenous Taiwanese . ↩ After taking control of Taiwan the KMT renamed countless streets, settlements, and administrative divisions to indoctrinate the population through geography. Among the concepts commonly imposed as place names are the Eight Virtues or Bādé ( 八德 ), typically paired off to yield four proper names: Zhōngxiào (忠孝, loyalty), Rén’ài (仁愛, benevolence), Xìnyì (信義, faith), and Hépíng (和平, peace). These names were assigned to the high mountain districts that had only been known as the “savage land” of their respective counties in Japanese times, an act of Indigenous erasure and nowadays an obvious candidate for reform through transitional justice legislation. Thus we have Heping in Taichung and Ren’ai and Xinyi in Nantou, but no Zhongxiao, because it sounds vulgar in Taiwanese Hokkien . As near as I can tell the highest administrative division with the name Zhongxiao is a village in Yilan—and it’s regularly the target of ridicule . Zhongxiao is used more often in Taipei but I suspect that’s only because Mandarin Chinese is more commonly spoken there. ↩ Several Taiwanese Indigenous peoples—primarily the Rukai , Paiwan , and some Bunun—traditionally constructed homes out of stacked stone slabs, usually slate. There are several sites in Pingtung where such dwellings can still be seen, for example in Lǎoqījiā (老七佳) and Kucapungane. For those who don’t often leave Taipei you will find an imitation stone slab house at the Taipei Campus of Shih Chien University (實踐大學臺北校區). ↩ This confusing barrage of nomenclature is a consequence of describing a place as well as the people who live there in several languages with multiple romanization systems. Most places in Taiwan have historic names in one or more Indigenous Taiwanese languages, Taiwanese Hokkien, Japanese, and Mandarin Chinese, all of which can be romanized in a variety of ways. In this case the original Bunun place name Buqaiz (or Boqaiv) was transliterated into Japanese as Bukai (from which Bogai and Vogai, other common names, are derived). A Mandarin Chinese reading of the Japanese kanji for Bukai is how we arrive at Wujie (formerly Wuchieh in the Wade–Giles romanization system ). The name of the community itself also dates back to Japanese times; originally they were called the Sabakam or the Sabakan, one of several communities of the Takituduh group of Bunun, who are known as the Zhuōshè (卓社群) in Chinese. ↩ The people of Sima-un were historically the Taqtaban (alternatiely: Kantaban, Kantavan and Gantaban) according to the Japanese. Qubing (sometimes romanized as Chuping) has no relation to these historic names—it is a Chinese place name derived from the visual appearance of the nearby riverbed. Ququaz, a place, is sometimes referred to as Gogowa, probably the original Japanese name. ↩ It should be noted that the only link established between the Qubing Indigenous community and the Qubing site is entirely an accident of geography. Whether the Bunun are the descendants of the people who lived here thousands of years ago is unknown. What we do know is that the Bunun only recently acquired this territory. ↩ Administratively this is Qīn’ài Village (親愛村), home to three Taiwanese Indigenous peoples: Truku, Seediq, and Atayal. Pulan itself is only the Truku part of the village from what I can tell. In Japanese times it was known as Inago, and it seems the ruins of the original Japanese garrison can still be found nearby.

The next post in this series details some of what you’ll see in Puli itself and will conclude with posts about Sun Moon Lake and Xinyi Township. Hopefully you’ve found this informative—it ended up being much more work than I had expected given the paucity of English language writing about this remote region of Taiwan. Many thanks to Andrew Kerslake for reviewing this post! Subjects of the Qing emperor were forbidden to cross into “savage lands” but the Taiwanese interior was virtually lawless in those days. Informal trade, intermarriage, and violence occurred all along the frontier, not unlike what we imagine of the heavily mythologized American Wild West . For more about this subject I strongly recommend picking up a copy of Outcasts of Empire: Japan’s Rule on Taiwan’s “Savage Border,” 1874-1945 by Paul D. Barclay, available here . For a brief overview check out this review by Michael Turton . Also worth noting: despite a century of population changes Ren’ai Township remains approximately 80% Indigenous Taiwanese . ↩ After taking control of Taiwan the KMT renamed countless streets, settlements, and administrative divisions to indoctrinate the population through geography. Among the concepts commonly imposed as place names are the Eight Virtues or Bādé ( 八德 ), typically paired off to yield four proper names: Zhōngxiào (忠孝, loyalty), Rén’ài (仁愛, benevolence), Xìnyì (信義, faith), and Hépíng (和平, peace). These names were assigned to the high mountain districts that had only been known as the “savage land” of their respective counties in Japanese times, an act of Indigenous erasure and nowadays an obvious candidate for reform through transitional justice legislation. Thus we have Heping in Taichung and Ren’ai and Xinyi in Nantou, but no Zhongxiao, because it sounds vulgar in Taiwanese Hokkien . As near as I can tell the highest administrative division with the name Zhongxiao is a village in Yilan—and it’s regularly the target of ridicule . Zhongxiao is used more often in Taipei but I suspect that’s only because Mandarin Chinese is more commonly spoken there. ↩ Several Taiwanese Indigenous peoples—primarily the Rukai , Paiwan , and some Bunun—traditionally constructed homes out of stacked stone slabs, usually slate. There are several sites in Pingtung where such dwellings can still be seen, for example in Lǎoqījiā (老七佳) and Kucapungane. For those who don’t often leave Taipei you will find an imitation stone slab house at the Taipei Campus of Shih Chien University (實踐大學臺北校區). ↩ This confusing barrage of nomenclature is a consequence of describing a place as well as the people who live there in several languages with multiple romanization systems. Most places in Taiwan have historic names in one or more Indigenous Taiwanese languages, Taiwanese Hokkien, Japanese, and Mandarin Chinese, all of which can be romanized in a variety of ways. In this case the original Bunun place name Buqaiz (or Boqaiv) was transliterated into Japanese as Bukai (from which Bogai and Vogai, other common names, are derived). A Mandarin Chinese reading of the Japanese kanji for Bukai is how we arrive at Wujie (formerly Wuchieh in the Wade–Giles romanization system ). The name of the community itself also dates back to Japanese times; originally they were called the Sabakam or the Sabakan, one of several communities of the Takituduh group of Bunun, who are known as the Zhuōshè (卓社群) in Chinese. ↩ The people of Sima-un were historically the Taqtaban (alternatiely: Kantaban, Kantavan and Gantaban) according to the Japanese. Qubing (sometimes romanized as Chuping) has no relation to these historic names—it is a Chinese place name derived from the visual appearance of the nearby riverbed. Ququaz, a place, is sometimes referred to as Gogowa, probably the original Japanese name. ↩ It should be noted that the only link established between the Qubing Indigenous community and the Qubing site is entirely an accident of geography. Whether the Bunun are the descendants of the people who lived here thousands of years ago is unknown. What we do know is that the Bunun only recently acquired this territory. ↩ Administratively this is Qīn’ài Village (親愛村), home to three Taiwanese Indigenous peoples: Truku, Seediq, and Atayal. Pulan itself is only the Truku part of the village from what I can tell. In Japanese times it was known as Inago, and it seems the ruins of the original Japanese garrison can still be found nearby.

In October 2015 I set out from Taichung to attend a music festival in Nantou , the landlocked county in the mountainous interior of Taiwan . Since I don’t often have an opportunity to ride a scooter I allocated some extra time for onward exploration and ended up visiting many interesting and wonderful places, many of them quite obscure. What follows is the first part of a mostly visual record of this road trip around the geographic center of Taiwan… View Image Details A famous gatehouse in Wufeng. The style is an eclectic mix of influences that make it purely Taiwanese. After arriving in Taichung by train I picked up my ride, stopped for ice cream at the amazing Fourth Credit Union (第四信用合作社), and hit the road, cutting south through Dali into Wufeng . Here I stopped to photograph the iconic Jǐngxūn Gatehouse (景熏樓), originally constructed in 1867. What you see here is not the original building—it was severely damaged in an earthquake and rebuilt in an eclectic style fusing Western, Japanese, and traditional Chinese influences in the 1930s 1 . This gatehouse is part of the much larger Wufeng Lin Family Mansion and Garden (霧峰林家宅園), something I didn’t have the time to see on this trip, but would strongly recommend to anyone with an interest in Taiwanese architecture and history. View Image Details Láiyuán Road ( 萊園路 ) facing east toward the mountains. View Image Details An industry of broken parts by the roadside in Wufeng. View Image Details An oddly-placed bench bearing the flag of the Republic of China in Guangfu New Village. Further south I made a small detour to scope out Guāngfù New Village (光復新村), one of the very few military villages slated for preservation, and the 921 Earthquake Museum (九二一地震教育園區). I then merged with Provincial Highway 3 to cross the Wū River (烏溪) into Caotun . All photos from this point forward were taken in Nantou County. View Image Details A stone garden by the roadside not long before sundown. A stone garden (shídiāoyuán 石雕園) by the roadside is the first thing that caught my eye after entering Nantou. The exact significance of each item escapes me but I’ve learned the traditional marble column is known as a huábiǎo (華表)—and I’ve seen the orb described as a Nine Dragon Ball (九龍球). Several stone lanterns line the laneway leading to Yùhuáng Temple (玉皇宮), a fairly large house of worship venerating the Jade Emperor (玉皇大帝). I wondered if those lanterns had once belonged to a long-vanished Shinto Shrine (神社) but they seem a bit plain. The inside of the temple wasn’t all that unusual but I captured the traditional three-footed censer ( sānzú yuánlú 三足圓爐 ) and a bunch of fortunes ( qiānshī 籤詩 ) dangling from hooks on the wall. View Image Details The gateway to Yuhuang Temple in rural Caotun. View Image Details The outer censer, one foot facing the world. View Image Details DIY fortune telling inside a temple in Caotun. View Image Details An old stone lantern with a halo of soot. Evidently it has seen some use but not for quite some time. View Image Details Back on the road again, this time with a view of the jagged 99 Peaks on the horizon. The catastrophic 921 Earthquake struck Nantou in 1999, extinguishing thousands of lives, knocking down countless buildings, and reshaping entire landscapes. One of those landscapes is the Ninety-Nine Peaks ( 九九峰 ), rugged hills completely denuded of vegetation as a result of the many landslides caused by the quake. Much of the vegetation has grown back in the nearly two decades since then—but the jagged contours of these steep hills remain readily apparent to anyone passing through this valley on their way to Puli and Sun Moon Lake (日月潭). If you’re curious about this geographic feature have a look at this drone footage for more. View Image Details The sluggish Wu River sweeping through the eastern plains of Caotun Township, Nantou County. View Image Details Taking a scenic detour across Pinglin Bridge. View Image Details The rusted hulk of some kind of machine likely involved in the gravel extraction industry. View Image Details The Koxinga monument at the entrance to Guoxing. View Image Details Nothing much to do out here but drink, is there? I made another brief detour to check out central Guoxing , fully expecting to see some old shophouses or other points of interest, but saw almost nothing apart from the Koxinga (國姓爺) monument at the southern end of town. Guoxing is named after Koxinga, the pirate king who vanquished the Dutch and established the short-lived Kingdom of Tungning (東寧王國) in southwestern Taiwan. He never came anywhere near this part of Taiwan but several of his generals camped near here while engaging Indigenous forces from the Kingdom of Middag ( 大肚王國 ) around 1670. The wholesale slaughter drove Indigenous Taiwanese emigration from the coastal plains into the more remote Puli Basin (埔里盆地), which was not officially opened to Han Chinese settlement until 1875. It strikes me as a tasteless choice of names, not unlike naming a town after Christopher Columbus in America. View Image Details An awesome Hakka restaurant at the western end of Puli. View Image Details View Image Details I arrived in Puli after nightfall, checked into a hotel, and went out for dinner at Yàzhuō Local Hakka Cuisine (亞卓鄉土客家菜). This was a wise choice—it has since become one of my favourite restaurants in Taiwan and I always make a point of dining here when I’m passing through Puli. View Image Details Neon lights of Puli. That’s all for the first day of this trip. I covered around 60 kilometers in all, which is not a lot, but the goal was to take it easy and see more of Nantou County. I’ll have more to share in the near future as I work through the backlog of photographs and notes from this trip. Stay tuned! For comparison, have a look at the Jishan Gatehouse in nearby Taiyuan. ↩

Lóngténg Broken Bridge (龍騰斷橋) is a historic roadside attraction in the rolling hills of Sanyi in southern Miaoli , Taiwan . More formally known as Yúténgpíng Broken Bridge ( 魚藤坪斷橋 ), it was originally constructed in 1907 during the Japanese colonial era , connecting Zhunan and Taichung along what is now known as the Old Mountain Line (舊山線). The bridge collapsed during the devastating 1935 Hsinchu-Taichung Earthquake but the ruins were never cleared away. Further damage was done in the 921 Earthquake in 1999. Several years later, in 2003, it was designated a historic site by the county government and subsequently developed for tourism along with the former Shèngxìng Railway Station (勝興車站). View Image Details The ruins of a Japanese colonial era railway bridge in the hills of Miaoli, Taiwan. The original bridge had a hybrid design, combining brick archways at both ends with a central steel truss for a total length of 165 meters. After suffering damage in the 1935 quake the steel truss was dismantled, leaving behind only the cracked piers and crumbling archways. A new iron bridge with a span of 200 meters was completed in 1938 immediately to the north, and while it hasn’t been in regular service since around 1998, the TRA still runs special trains down this line on occasion.

View Image Details The angular outline of a bridge pier in the jungle. View Image Details From the far side of the valley. View Image Details This end of the collapsed bridge is far more scenic and overgrown. Tourist brochures and online promotions typically focus on the more exposed ruins of the bridge on the northeastern side, close to the souvenir stalls, snack vendors, and parking lots, but it is worth taking the time to see the far side of the bridge too. The most iconic segment of the bridge consists of three piers and partial archways still standing and a fourth that collapsed in the 921 Earthquake. A short trail descends into the valley from this point, and after a few minutes one will reach the shadowy side of the valley, which is home to several more piers colonized by banyan trees.

View Image Details The historic Baekje Hospital in Busan, originally constructed in 1922. The former Baekje Hospital is a heritage building in Busan , the second largest city in South Korea . Built in 1922 by Choi Yong-hae, a Korean living in Japan, it is located in Choryang, Busan’s historic Chinatown. It was the first private hospital in the city but only remained in business for about a decade before the building was repurposed. Over the years the former hospital has been used as army barracks, police station, Chinese restaurant, wedding hall, and more. This was even the home of a consulate for the Republic of China (now generally known as Taiwan ) at some point, probably long before diplomatic recognition ended in 1992 . View Image Details A closer look at the fourth floor of the hospital. A fifth floor was removed after a fire in 1972. View Image Details The oddly-shaped entrance on the ground floor of the former hospital. View Image Details An old wooden banister. View Image Details A charred door frame. View Image Details On the upper floors of the former hospital. Everything up here has been stripped down to the bone. View Image Details Wandering through the abandoned parts of the old hospital. I visited the former Baekje Hospital 1 in 2016 while roaming around the area in search of traces of colonial architecture with this excellent blog as my guide. Most of the upper levels were stripped down to the brickwork, awaiting further renovations or perhaps ready for new tenants. The ground floor had already been transformed into Brown Hands 백제 , a designer café that I ended up working out of for three days of my trip. At that time they were running an exhibition of sculptures by Wang Ji-Won entitled The Passion , several of which were activated by motion sensors. It was an interesting choice for the otherwise unaltered space, a collision of past and future. View Image Details The narrow entrance to the cafe on the ground floor. View Image Details View Image Details View Image Details Daylight seeping into the former hospital, now a highly atmospheric cafe. View Image Details Behind the bar at Brown Hands Cafe. Apart from its location in a historic building this was actually one of the better cafes I found on this trip to Busan. In a few days wandering around Busan this was by far the most significant and interesting colonial building I managed to find. Unlike Taiwan , which is still home to many remnants of the Japanese colonial era , South Korea has expunged almost all trace of those tragic times . I wonder if this hospital was spared, in part, because it has more of a Korean pedigree. I already cited it in the text above but I highly recommend reading Colonial Korea if you’re interested in the subject. For reference, the kanji printed on the sign out front is 百濟病院. ↩

Xiluo is a small historic town in rural Yunlin , Taiwan . Despite its diminutive size Xiluo was once home to three standalone movie theaters: the eponymous Xiluo Theater (西螺戲院), Yisheng Theater (一生戲院), and Yuǎndōng Theater (遠東戲院, literally “Far East Theater”), the subject of this brief report. Previously I misidentified Yisheng Theater as Yuandong, something I only learned after visiting a photo exhibition at Huashan 1914 Creative Park in 2017. After realizing my mistake I went to some lengths to locate and later visit this theater—which, in hindsight, I’ve passed on several occasions without noticing it down a small side street of the same name. View Image Details In front of Xiluo’s abandoned Yuandong Theater, located down a small alleyway. View Image Details The former ticket booth now collects trash. The rooms beyond the window are used for storing all manner of farming equipment and supplies. View Image Details Deteriorated remains of the projection room. View Image Details A charred wooden beam draped with poultry netting. There is nothing particularly photogenic about the charred remains of this KMT authoritarian era cinema. The front of the building shows evidence of a fire and most of the back of the structure—including the stage, screen, and rooftop—has been completely removed.

View Image Details Chicken cages and the projection room, easily identified by its staggered portholes. View Image Details The view from the balcony. What was once a theater has become a small urban farm. Not much can be found online about Yuandong Theater, a consequence of the common name (which was used dozens of times all around Taiwan, making it tricky to isolate in search results) and the presence of Xiluo’s much more famous Japanese colonial era theater just down the street. Government records are scant, though I did manage to turn up one reference to a meeting that took place at Yuandong Theater in 1967, neatly establishing an upper limit for the date of construction. The only other reference I found to Yuandong appears in this human interest story about a local painter who used to make movie posters around town. View Image Details Yuandong Theater from around back. Here you can see where the original rooftop would have met the front of the building. I would not recommend going out of your way to visit this decrepit old building—it was completed dismantled in late 2018, leaving nothing more than an empty lot that has since been replaced by a new housing development. It is still visible on Google Street View if you know how to use the time travel feature.

The ruins of the former Língxiāo Temple 凌霄殿 can be found in the foothills of the Central Mountain Range 中央山脈 in Puli , Nantou . Likely named after the Chinese trumpet creeper, Campsis grandiflora ( 中文 ), it was founded in 1983 by local philanthropist Chen Chou 陳綢 , famous across Taiwan for her charity work . The temple is quite remote, more than 10 kilometers down an old forestry road with no other exit, perched on the hillside at an elevation of 1,300 meters (for reference, the Puli Basin 埔里盆地 is around 500 meters above sea level).

Nobody warned me about how dangerous it would be so I’ll be blunt: this is not a place for casual exploration and I take no responsibility for anyone who might visit. You’d be foolish not to bring proper safety gear or a drone if you go check it out—but again, I do not recommend it. If you’re interested in seeing something similar I strongly suggest visiting Wuchang Temple in nearby Jiji .

The ruins of the former Língxiāo Temple 凌霄殿 can be found in the foothills of the Central Mountain Range 中央山脈 in Puli , Nantou . Likely named after the Chinese trumpet creeper, Campsis grandiflora ( 中文 ), it was founded in 1983 by local philanthropist Chen Chou 陳綢 , famous across Taiwan for her charity work . The temple is quite remote, more than 10 kilometers down an old forestry road with no other exit, perched on the hillside at an elevation of 1,300 meters (for reference, the Puli Basin 埔里盆地 is around 500 meters above sea level).

Located on the outskirts of Zhushan , Kēzikēng New Community 柯子坑新社區 is one of several public housing projects constructed in the aftermath of the 921 Earthquake that devastated central Taiwan in 1999. Despite providing much-needed relief for those who lost their homes in the disaster there were few buyers—and today the complex remains mostly empty and disused. Built with government funds, this poorly-conceived housing project has become yet another example of what Taiwanese call mosquito halls , a term popularized by artist Yao Jui-chung 姚瑞中 and a team of student researchers known as Lost Society Document. Since 2010 they have published six volumes of Mirage , a series of works identifying more than 800 disused public properties all around the country. Some of their work was translated into English —which is how I found out about this particular locale, which I briefly visited in the summer of 2017. View Image Details Disused public property on the outskirts of Zhushan in Nantou County. View Image Details The main thoroughfare running through the community. From a distance Kezikeng New Community looks like a decent place to live, though the location is somewhat remote from the nearest town and there are few amenities in the immediate area. There’s a good chance it was built here simply because the government already owned the land, which is adjacent to the former Zhushan Sugar Factory 竹山糖廠 (see here for more info). Decades ago this site was occupied by what I would assume (from aerial photographs) were warehouses—and the sugar railway network ran along the main road just outside the front gates of this community. View Image Details There seems to be some half-hearted attempt at fixing broken homes. Apart from the obscure location it also sounds as if these townhouses, despite being billed as “affordable housing”, were too expensive . I’m no expert on the Taiwanese real estate market but 2 million NT and up does seem like a lot for a townhouse in the middle of nowhere. Repeated attempts by the state to auction idle units do not appear to have been met with an enthusiastic response—but the government is still sinking money into the project, renovating some of the more dilapidated units as recently as 2016. View Image Details Crumbling townhouses in the countryside, waiting for the next disaster. View Image Details Jagged remnants of the front of one of the townhouses. View Image Details Slipping into the back alley between townhouse rows. View Image Details The gatehouse seems to have been empty for quite some time.

Guóbīn Commercial Building 國賓商業大樓 is an ugly ruin in the heart of Zhongli , a city of around half a million people in Taoyuan , Taiwan . Built at the dawn of the booming 1980s, it was home to a variety of entertainment businesses over the years, and appears to have been mostly abandoned sometime around the turn of the millennium. Much to my surprise I’ve not found much about this place online, which suggests whatever newsworthy calamities befell this derelict commercial building predate the era of digital journalism. Without any sources to draw upon I can only make some educated guesses about what I captured during a brief visit in the early days of 2017. View Image Details The derelict Guobin Commercial Building in the heart of Zhongli’s old entertainment district. View Image Details Ground floor entrance to the hostess bar on 2F. View Image Details Breaking down the lounge door. View Image Details One of a dozen private rooms in the gentleman’s club on the second floor. View Image Details Strange, but I think I’ve seen that bunny somewhere before… View Image Details This floor is in better shape than the others, which isn’t saying much. View Image Details A small stage in the main room of a gentleman’s club in Zhongli. As with many ruined entertainment complexes in Taiwan this one isn’t completely abandoned—you’ll still find a run-of-the-mill betel nut stand out front, for example—but most of the rest of the building is a dangerous, crumbling ruin. The second floor is occupied by the remains of Shuǐzhōnghuā Jiǔdiàn 水中花酒店, a hostess bar and karaoke club named after a famous song by Cantopop legend Alan Tam 譚詠麟 . A jiudian is a place where men drink and cavort with women but they’re not exactly brothels and sex isn’t necessarily on the menu (despite what the blatant appropriation of the Playboy bunny logo might suggest 1 ). Such disreputable establishments are commonplace in Taiwan and dozens more can still be found in this part of Zhongli. View Image Details The charred remains of whatever was on the third floor. View Image Details This could have been a bar, nightclub, restaurant, or something else. View Image Details Fire damage on the third floor. Making art from the charred remains. The fire that swept through the third floor cleansed it of anything that would reliably identify what it had been. The charred remains could be those of a bar, restaurant, nightclub, arcade, or something else entirely. Business records suggest this was a dessert shop for much of the 1990s but it’s hard to say if it was still in business when the blaze broke out.

The fourth floor is home to the smaller of two cinemas found within the building, part of the eponymous Guobin Theater 國賓大戲院. Business records suggest the theater occupied both 4F and 5F since 1980 but I have my doubts about this. The lower theater is unusually cramped—just look at those concrete beams running along the ceiling. It also looks like the screen would have been illuminated from behind, an unusual setup for old theaters in Taiwan. Finally, the crude printed sign welcoming customers on the fourth floor contrasts with the proper sign on the fifth. I would speculate that the theater on the fifth annexed the fourth floor at some point in the 1990s. View Image Details A more official sign for the Guobin Theater.

View Image Details Staggered holes inside the projection room. No sign of the original equipment remains. It is clear from the layout and design of the fifth floor that it was purpose-built to be a movie theater. Here you will find a projection room—but no projectors, for the building is far too exposed to have retained anything of value—as well as a big silver screen. The screen is framed by red velvet curtains advertising a defunct brand of soft drinks 2 .

View Image Details A scorched wall and the remains of a sign imploring guests not to spit betel nut juice on the floor. The sixth floor is in bad shape after a fire, quite likely the same blaze that struck the third. It is difficult to discern whether the cabaret was already out of business but it is not uncommon for fires to break out in abandoned buildings in Taiwan. The interior of this building is in very rough shape and there are holes in the floor in several locations. Be sure to take appropriate precautions should you wish to explore this ruin—although I should note that as of 2019 the entire building has been sealed and there is no obvious means of entry.

View Image Details A closer look at the decrepit sign still hanging out front. View Image Details One last glance at the Guobin Commercial Building in Zhongli. One additional mystery presents itself after a close inspection of the exterior of the building. Here we can discern the remains of a sign for Lánjíyǎ 蘭吉雅, the Chinese transliteration of the Lancia brand of automobiles.

In the late 1980s it was known as Guóxīn Cabaret 國新大歌廳 (as seen in this vintage poster from 1989 ) and, still later, Dōngfāng Cabaret 東方大歌廳, but I suspect it reverted to its original name at least once.

What remains of Xīnxīng Theater 新興戲院 can be found just east of the train station in Dalin , a modest town of approximately 30,000 just north of Chiayi City in Taiwan . Despite its relatively small size Dalin once supported five movie theaters, providing entertainment for sugar factory workers and the many soldiers stationed at nearby military bases. Xinxing Theater (not to be confused with the one in Xinpu ) originally opened as Rénshān Theater 仁山戲院 in 1954 and remained in business until 1992. Eventually the theater was renovated and subdivided into a billiards hall and KTV (also known as a karaoke box ) before it was finally abandoned sometime around 2013. Recently there was talk of buying the property and transforming it into a creative market but its ultimate fate remained unknown until it was finally demolished in 2019. View Image Details Outside the derelict Xinxing Theater in Dalin, Chiayi County. View Image Details A closer look at the asymmetric facade of an old theater in small town Chiayi. View Image Details Twin ticket booths on either side of the shuttered entrance. Dalin is the epicenter of an unlikely cinematic renaissance spearheaded by Jiāng Mínghè 江明赫, a professional soldier and theater enthusiast profiled in this excellent article (in Chinese but worth running through Google Translate). Thanks to his efforts Wànguó Theater 萬國戲院 , located a short distance away from Xinxing Theater on the other side of the railway line, was recently restored and reopened for special events and film screenings. He is also quite active online, operating several Facebook pages including one dedicated to Xinxing Theater , and has unflinchingly documented the histories of many theaters around southern Taiwan 1 . View Image Details The ground floor was formerly a billiards hall. During my visit it appeared as if some renovation work might begin in this dusty, neglected space. View Image Details Ground floor washrooms at the old Xinxing Theater looking quite seedy. View Image Details The upper levels housed a lightless karaoke box, the sort of establishment where scantily-clad performers singing on stage might be available for private shows in numbered rooms. View Image Details On the menu at the old KTV. View Image Details KTV room 301. View Image Details An abandoned KTV machine. View Image Details The view from within a ground floor ticket booth. One of the more interesting themes to emerge from Jiang’s accounts of the history of theater in Dalin is the close association with the erotic entertainment industry. Showing erotic films is commonly a symptom of decline in the theater business—but in Dalin it sounds as if Jiǎn Déqīng 簡德卿, town mayor in the 1950s, actively supported the development of theaters and teahouses specializing in the carnal arts. In fact, the former mayor was responsible for building two theaters in town , including the one seen in this post 2 . Even in the booming years of the 1960s these theaters were known for lewd stage shows and stripteases, a practice known locally as niúròuchǎng 牛肉場 (literally “beef market”), although these were by no means the only forms of entertainment offered here. View Image Details An oblique view of the old theater showing signs added in the 1990s. View Image Details One final look at the nameplate above the old Xinxing Theater. Finally, I noticed a striking similarity between the architectural style of Xinxing Theater and Yuandong Theater in Beidou . Both were built around the same time so there’s a decent chance the same architect may have been involved. Update : this theater was demolished in late 2019. Despite the unusual abundance of photos and information available online this theater was one of my random finds on Google Maps. It’s interesting what you can find browsing around satellite maps in search of buildings of the expected dimensions! ↩ Rénhǎi Theater 仁海戲院, renamed Dōngyà Theater 東亞戲院 after it was sold to a new owner, was located just around the corner from Xinxing Theater. It was reputedly in operation until 1992 and was demolished in 2016 . One more small note: both theaters are located along a street named after this famous mayor! ↩

One of the more interesting themes to emerge from Jiang’s accounts of the history of theater in Dalin is the close association with the erotic entertainment industry. Showing erotic films is commonly a symptom of decline in the theater business—but in Dalin it sounds as if Jiǎn Déqīng 簡德卿, town mayor in the 1950s, actively supported the development of theaters and teahouses specializing in the carnal arts. In fact, the former mayor was responsible for building two theaters in town , including the one seen in this post 2 . Even in the booming years of the 1960s these theaters were known for lewd stage shows and stripteases, a practice known locally as niúròuchǎng 牛肉場 (literally “beef market”), although these were by no means the only forms of entertainment offered here. View Image Details An oblique view of the old theater showing signs added in the 1990s. View Image Details One final look at the nameplate above the old Xinxing Theater. Finally, I noticed a striking similarity between the architectural style of Xinxing Theater and Yuandong Theater in Beidou . Both were built around the same time so there’s a decent chance the same architect may have been involved. Update : this theater was demolished in late 2019. Despite the unusual abundance of photos and information available online this theater was one of my random finds on Google Maps. It’s interesting what you can find browsing around satellite maps in search of buildings of the expected dimensions! ↩ Rénhǎi Theater 仁海戲院, renamed Dōngyà Theater 東亞戲院 after it was sold to a new owner, was located just around the corner from Xinxing Theater. It was reputedly in operation until 1992 and was demolished in 2016 . One more small note: both theaters are located along a street named after this famous mayor! ↩

The corpses of a thousand factories lay strewn across the plains of central and south Taiwan , stark reminders of an extraordinary period of economic growth in the latter half of the 20th century. Those located in more rural areas are readily forgotten and may remain derelict for years to come—but the more prosperous districts are busily excising these unsightly engines of economic growth from their urban landscapes. Progress is inconsistent, however, and it isn’t at all unusual to chance upon the hulking ruins of inner city factories that have yet to disappear. One such factory is the Yìchéng Cannery 義成罐頭工廠, an impressive complex hemmed in on all sides by residences in a network of winding alleyways not far from the train station in Yuanlin , the second-largest city in Changhua . No doubt this ugly eyesore will be demolished sometime in the near future—but in the meantime it has become a shadow world for local youth and curious outsiders such as myself.

Ershui is a rural township located in the southeastern corner of Changhua , bordering Yunlin and Nantou . Ershui Station 二水車站 , constructed in 1935, is the primary point of transfer between the Main Line 縱貫線 of the Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) and the Jiji Line 集集線 , a tourist railway leading into the interior. Ershui, which literally means “two water”, is named after the Bābǎo Canal 八堡圳 , an extensive system of artificial waterways still responsible for irrigating much of the Changhua Plain 彰化平原 three centuries after it was devised. During the Japanese colonial era this small town prospered as a center of woodworking while farmers in the countryside cultivated bananas, grapes, guava, and tobacco, among other crops. Nowadays it is mainly known as a sleepy stopover on the way to parts beyond—but a closer look will reveal several points of interest for anyone curious about Taiwanese history, architecture, and vintage style. View Image Details The modest railway station building in Ershui dates back to 1935 but has been renovated with tile and a new paint scheme since then. View Image Details The first of several old red brick mansions, the Zhèng Dǐng House 鄭鼎宅 . Ershui offers an interesting case study in small town urban planning in Taiwan. The original Qing dynasty era settlement can still be found at the southern edge of town, distinguished by a maze of laneways and a motley collection of traditional three-sided courtyard homes . The railway station—which originally opened in 1905—was built some distance to the north of the existing village, and the main street connecting the two is where you’ll find most remaining traces of colonial times 1 . View Image Details Another red brick building on the main street, Xiè Máo House 謝毛宅 . Notice the “M” on the top of the facade? View Image Details The sprawling red brick Zhāng Lǎoyīng House 張老嚶宅 . That’s the former owner’s name, by the way! Not far from the railway staton you’ll encounter a trifecta of red brick buildings: Zhèng Dǐng House 鄭鼎宅, Xiè Máo House 謝毛宅, and Zhāng Lǎoyīng House 張老嚶宅, all named after their original owners, wealthy members of the local gentry in Japanese times. Zheng Ding studied medicine in Taipei and returned to his hometown to found Yīngyuán Hospital 英源醫院, the first western-style clinic in Ershui, which was based in the building that still bears his name. The other two were more focused on trade and commerce from what I’ve read. View Image Details An old shophouse near the station. This was a newspaper stall, once upon a time. View Image Details Another distinctive shophouse further around the bend from the old public hall. View Image Details An old shop offering denture repair ( 整修假牙 ). Many more hand-painted signs can be found in Ershui if you go looking. View Image Details A curious feature of many temples in Changhua: carp-shaped incense holders ( 鯉魚形的香爐 ) mounted next to the entrance. View Image Details The old fire station and new post office. From what I’ve read the fire station was originally someone’s home in colonial times. It certainly doesn’t look like it was built for its current use, does it? View Image Details The ruins of the Ershui Assembly Hall 二水公會堂 , built in 1930, can be found just south of the station. The administrative center of colonial Ershui is immediately south of the old red brick shophouses. Here there is a bend in the road, which curves east to run along the perimeter of the old Qing dynasty settlement area. Along the outer rim of the bend: a new post office (almost certainly built on the original site of the first post office in town); an old fire station, apparently a repurposed colonial house on private land ; an open patch of ground that was until recently an old police station (see this link for a photo); the historic but unprotected ruins of the Ershui Assembly Hall 二水公會堂 (follow the link for my full post); and finally, a rare and historic wooden office of the Hoko system (also described in my full post about the hall). From what I understand a legal battle over the fate of these buildings has not been resolved—but if the land owner has his way the remaining structures will be knocked down just like the police station. View Image Details Hónghé Hospital 宏和醫院 , built in 1933. Despite its obvious historic value I haven’t been able to find out much about it. View Image Details The faded text below the sign reads Kō-Wa Hospital, mixing the Japanese romanization of the name (Honghe) and, inexplicably, a little English! I would be surprised to find out this were original. Further around the bend one will find several more shophouses and the Hónghé Hospital 宏和醫院, built in 1933 (if the date on the facade is to be trusted). I’m somewhat surprised that none of my many sources about the history of Ershui have much to say about this building, though from what I gather it is still owned by the founder’s family, which would explain its present state of neatness despite having not seen any real use in decades. I was intrigued to learn that the text below the sign—Kō-Wa Hospital—includes the Japanese romanization for “Honghe”. Something tells me this is a late addition to the design of the building. View Image Details An abandoned tobacco barn in the small village of Kǔlíngjiǎo 苦苓腳 . View Image Details Inside a tobacco barn on the right bank of the Zhoushui River in Ershui. The curing chamber is through the doors on the right. View Image Details The remains of another tobacco barn sandwiched between more modern residences in this tiny village. Head out into the countryside and you might find traces of the tobacco industry in Ershui’s many small villages. Tobacco is no longer cultivated here but several tobacco barns —chimneyed buildings purpose-built for curing tobacco before shipping leaves to market—can still be found. The flat-topped chimneys are unique in my experience—nowhere else have I seen tobacco barns with such a design. From what I’ve read Ershui was the only part of Changhua deemed suitable for tobacco cultivation in the late Japanese colonial era 2 . View Image Details Overlooking a more modern complex of sluice gates controlling inflow to the historic Babao Canal. No post about Ershui would be complete without at least one picture of the historic Bābǎo Canal 八堡圳 , originally built in the early 18th century to capture part of the Zhuóshuǐ River 濁水溪 , the longest river in Taiwan, and irrigate the Changhua Plain. The canal system has been extensively modified since it was first built with the guidance of the mysterious Mr. Lin, the fabled progenitor venerated at a nearby temple I haven’t yet had the opportunity to visit 3 . Nowadays the water entering the canal system is diverted from the Jiji Weir 集集攔河堰 , an engineering project only completed in 2001. The sluice gates in this picture might have been built at the same time. View Image Details Zhānghóng Woodworking Factory 章宏製材工廠 , an unusual building that might date back to the late Japanese colonial era. View Image Details The name of the factory is emblazoned on an ornate column surrounded by pink sheet metal. I wonder what the rest of the building looks like? Back in town one may notice the ruins of the Zhānghóng Woodworking Factory 章宏製材工廠. I’ve not found much in the way of credible historic information about this building—only this post came up in a search—but it evidently dates back to the late colonial period. Ershui was once a transfer point for timber coming down from the mountains of Nantou so it makes sense that you’d find some woodworking shops in town. While the front of the building is sealed tight an open window around back will afford a glimpse of the rusting hulks of old, discarded machinery inside. View Image Details The CT278 steam locomotive on display to the west of the train station. Purchased from Japan, it was in service until 1983. View Image Details One of hundreds of F5-E Flying Tigers produced in Taiwan from 1974 to 1986. These planes were stenciled with “Chung Chen” (pinyin: Zhōng Zhèng 中正 ) on the nose to honor the late dictator, Chiang Kai-shek. On one of my most recent trips to Ershui 4 I was surprised to see an old steam engine and fighter plane on display a little west of the railway station. These are located in a small park that was under reconstruction when I visited, but the workers didn’t mind me poking around and taking a few photos. The CT278 steam engine displayed here was purchased from Japan in 1953 with the assistance of USAID and was in service until 1983 5 . The Republic of China Air Force (RCAF) fighter plane is a Northrop F5-E Flying Tiger II built and assembled here in Taiwan, probably in the late 1970s.

View Image Details A bronze bust of generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in front of a faded KMT party emblem in a military dependents’ village in Hsinchu. Pictured here is a bronze bust of generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in front of the faded emblem of the Kuomintang (KMT) in Xìnyì New Village 信義新村 , a military dependents’ village in Hsinchu City . Chiang and the KMT retreated to Taiwan with more than a million Chinese soldiers and their dependents in 1949, bolstering an existing population of seven million Taiwanese. This instantly created a massive housing crisis—all those people needed places to live! The new regime attempted to address this through the development of hundreds of military dependents’ villages , gated enclaves of KMT soldiers and their families, but those were chaotic, desperate, and uncertain times, and many more ended up in informal and often illegal settlements all around Taiwan. This particular military village has a somewhat different history and composition than most others. The expulsion of KMT soldiers from the Chinese mainland in 1949 was not the end of the Chinese Civil War . The communists made additional territorial gains in 1950, capturing several offshore islands, including Hainan , before the outbreak of the Korean War , which greatly exacerbated American fears of a communist takeover of Asia. The Seventh Fleet was deployed to discourage either side from crossing the Taiwan Strait for the next several years, allowing both the KMT and the communists to consolidate their positions and prepare for the resumption of open hostilities. What is now known as the First Taiwan Strait Crisis began in late 1954 and escalated with the Battle of Yijiangshan Islands in early 1955. Communist forces successfully invaded two rocky islets off the eastern coast, threatening the KMT garrison in the Dàchén Islands 大陳群島 , provisional capital of Chekiang Province , more than 300 kilometers north of Taiwan. Rather than stay and fight against overwhelming odds the KMT reluctantly agreed to evacuate the islands, encouraged by American military strategists to focus on defending a smaller number of offshore islands 1 . Thus the Battle of Dachen Archipelago ended in retreat, with the US Seventh Fleet using “132 boats and 400 aircraft to move 14,500 civilians, 10,000 Nationalist troops and 4,000 guerrillas, along with 40,000 tons of military equipment and supplies” to the port of Keelung in early February 1955 2 . View Image Details Gateway to a reconstructed Dachen New Village in Hsinchu flanked by patriotic couplets. The ROC government was far more organized in accommodating the influx of retreating soldiers and civilian refugees in 1955 than it had been in 1949. After staying in temporary housing in the Keelung area for some period of time the soldiers and refugees were resettled in approximately 35 areas that became known as Dachen New Villages 大陳新村 , mostly in eastern and southern Taiwan. Several of these villages were former Japanese immigrant settlements 移民村 , some accreted around existing Japanese military housing, and others were built from scratch. Nowadays only a handful of these villages remain , and many of those have been completely rebuilt and bear no resemblance to what you would have seen in the late 1950s 3 .

View Image Details A bronze bust of generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in front of a faded KMT party emblem in a military dependents’ village in Hsinchu. Pictured here is a bronze bust of generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in front of the faded emblem of the Kuomintang (KMT) in Xìnyì New Village 信義新村 , a military dependents’ village in Hsinchu City . Chiang and the KMT retreated to Taiwan with more than a million Chinese soldiers and their dependents in 1949, bolstering an existing population of seven million Taiwanese. This instantly created a massive housing crisis—all those people needed places to live! The new regime attempted to address this through the development of hundreds of military dependents’ villages , gated enclaves of KMT soldiers and their families, but those were chaotic, desperate, and uncertain times, and many more ended up in informal and often illegal settlements all around Taiwan. This particular military village has a somewhat different history and composition than most others. The expulsion of KMT soldiers from the Chinese mainland in 1949 was not the end of the Chinese Civil War . The communists made additional territorial gains in 1950, capturing several offshore islands, including Hainan , before the outbreak of the Korean War , which greatly exacerbated American fears of a communist takeover of Asia. The Seventh Fleet was deployed to discourage either side from crossing the Taiwan Strait for the next several years, allowing both the KMT and the communists to consolidate their positions and prepare for the resumption of open hostilities. What is now known as the First Taiwan Strait Crisis began in late 1954 and escalated with the Battle of Yijiangshan Islands in early 1955. Communist forces successfully invaded two rocky islets off the eastern coast, threatening the KMT garrison in the Dàchén Islands 大陳群島 , provisional capital of Chekiang Province , more than 300 kilometers north of Taiwan. Rather than stay and fight against overwhelming odds the KMT reluctantly agreed to evacuate the islands, encouraged by American military strategists to focus on defending a smaller number of offshore islands 1 . Thus the Battle of Dachen Archipelago ended in retreat, with the US Seventh Fleet using “132 boats and 400 aircraft to move 14,500 civilians, 10,000 Nationalist troops and 4,000 guerrillas, along with 40,000 tons of military equipment and supplies” to the port of Keelung in early February 1955 2 . View Image Details Gateway to a reconstructed Dachen New Village in Hsinchu flanked by patriotic couplets. The ROC government was far more organized in accommodating the influx of retreating soldiers and civilian refugees in 1955 than it had been in 1949. After staying in temporary housing in the Keelung area for some period of time the soldiers and refugees were resettled in approximately 35 areas that became known as Dachen New Villages 大陳新村 , mostly in eastern and southern Taiwan. Several of these villages were former Japanese immigrant settlements 移民村 , some accreted around existing Japanese military housing, and others were built from scratch. Nowadays only a handful of these villages remain , and many of those have been completely rebuilt and bear no resemblance to what you would have seen in the late 1950s 3 .

Nányún Gas Station (南雲加油站) is one of hundreds of abandoned gas stations found all around Taiwan . It was formerly affiliated with CPC Corporation ( 台灣中油 ), a state-owned enterprise that controls or supplies 80% of gas stations in the nation, and located on a section of Provincial Highway 3 in Yunlin known as Línshān Highway (林山公路), for it connects Linnei with Zhushan in neighboring Nantou . It was likely abandoned more than a decade ago, and for reasons that are less mundane than you might expect. View Image Details An abandoned gas station on the hazy borderlands of Yunlin and Nantou in Taiwan. View Image Details Derelict pumps lay idle beneath the plain gas station rooftop. There’s nothing especially remarkable about this gas station from the street. I’ve seen many more like it and really only decided to stop here on a whim, not having captured a full set of photographs from this class of ruin before. But, as with most of my explorations, what seemed like a simple write-up turns into something more involved after I started asking questions.

View Image Details There’s something really wonderful about these overgrown gas station pumps. Green energy! First, some history: CPC Corporation ( 台灣中油 ), formerly known as the Chinese Petroleum Corporation (中國石油), was founded by the ROC government in Shanghai in 1946. It was granted control of all existing oil industry infrastructure in Taiwan and operated as a state monopoly for the next half century or so. Some deregulation began in 1987 with the debut of a franchising system that allowed for private ownership of gas stations. The station in these photos, established in 1989 , was among the first wave of privately-owned gas stations in Taiwan, a lucrative line of business during the transition to democracy in the 1990s. The economy was still growing by leaps and bounds in the twilight of the Taiwan Miracle , vehicle sales were up, and more people were on the road for work and pleasure. View Image Details This particular pump served as a substrate for what looks to be a hornets’ nest . View Image Details The gaping entrance to what I would assume is the fuel tank beneath the gas station. Further deregulation introduced competition in the 2000s, most notably from the widely-loathed Formosa Petrochemical Corporation ( 台塑石化 ). Market saturation, decreasing economic growth, and the introduction of better public transit systems (particularly the high-speed rail) have steadily reduced demand 1 . More recently, CPC Corporation adjusted its rates and policies, tightening margins for private gas station owners and provoking at least one mass protest in 2014 . What was once a highly profitable business has become far more marginal in the last decade.

URL: https://spectralcodex.com/shezi-theater/
Shèzi Theater 社子大戲院 was founded in 1965 as the first open-air theater in Taipei . Located in southwestern Shilin , it was a fairly informal venue from the sounds of it: an empty lot surrounded by bamboo fencing with films projected on a single screen for up to 500 people every night, stars wheeling overhead. Within three years of opening the owners reinvested some of their profits in filling out the space, adding a balcony level and some rudimentary shelter from the elements. Eventually the theater moved into a more permanent building on the same site, perhaps as late as 1976, when it first appears in business records . The rise of home video in the 1980s gravely impacted the theater business, leading the owners to divide the cinema into two halls, but there was no way to survive the new economy. Shezi Theater closed in 1996, another victim of changing consumer habits in Taiwan . View Image Details A derelict theater hidden within a maze of alleyways in the heart of Shezi, an old part of Taipei just north of Dadaocheng. View Image Details The entrance to the theater with twin ticket booths on either side. I learned of this theater through Instagram of all places; someone I follow shared a photo from outside the ticket booth, immediately arousing my curiosity. Since it was given such a simple and descriptive name it wasn’t difficult to figure out its location: somewhere in the bowels of the eponymous Shezi Market 社子市場. Still, I am surprised I hadn’t heard of this particular theater—there aren’t many vintage cinemas left within Taipei city limits! Mixed use commercial and residential complex with theaters hidden away from the street were once fairly common in Taiwan, especially in the densely populated Taipei Basin 臺北盆地 , but few remain 1 . View Image Details Showtimes and ticket prices. Looking closely we can see that the last price for admission ( 票價 ) was 180 NT, with a 30 NT discount for students and veterans. Abandoned and mostly forgotten for nearly two decades, the theater was slated for destruction in 2015 , arousing some interest from the media in the form of this television news segment . Additional insight can be derived from this article , which contains two shots of the interior prior to renovation, and this gallery of photos (and accompanying text) on Facebook. Somewhat surprisingly, the theater is still standing in 2017, although the interior has been completely gutted. I wasn’t able to see much through the front gate but it appears as if it will be used for scooter parking. View Image Details This case has been frozen in time; it still shows the last film playing here from 1996! View Image Details Shezi Theater is not easy to shoot by virtue of its location within a multi-use market and residential complex. View Image Details This grimy sign still hangs over one of the entrances to the old Shezi Theater despite closing more than 20 years ago.

Here you will still find a poster for Lover of the Last Empress 慈禧秘密生活 , a salacious Hong Kong biopic of the Empress Dowager Cixi released in 1995 (see IMDb for more info). Finally, this general history of Shezi provides some context that may be of interest. The most famous of these is Fúhé Theater 福和大戲院, the subject of a future post. Apart from that, both the Guāngmíng Theater 光明戲院 and Miramar Theater 美麗華戲院 are still standing, but neither one is accessible last time I visited. ↩

Lùxìng Theater 陸興戲院 was one of the very first abandoned buildings I explored in Taiwan after arriving back in 2013. I had only been in Taipei for about a week when I took a day trip out to Pingxi , a popular tourist destination in New Taipei , and disembarked from the train at Shífēn Station ( 十分車站 ) on a whim. Everyone else on the train had the same idea—which meant the narrow street leading east to Shifen Waterfall (十分大瀑布), reputedly one of finest in the Greater Taipei Area (and my intended destination), was immediately overwhelmed with pedestrian traffic. View Image Details The ruins of an old movie theater just behind the bustling Shifen Old Street in Pingxi. Two small ticket windows can be seen near the entrance. View Image Details At the entrance to the old movie theater. When I shot these photos I had no idea what I was looking at. View Image Details Just a bunch of junk piled around the entrance, is it? Well, if you look closely, you might be able to discern the name of the theater written on the mirror leaning against the wall… Opting for a more serene route I ducked down an alleyway and soon find myself wandering backroads lined with buildings in various states of disrepair. One of these crumbling ruins was open to the street so I stepped inside and had a look around. What was this place, I wondered? A factory, perhaps? But I had no experience in the ruins of Taiwan , nor could I read any Chinese at that time, so I really wasn’t sure what this place might have been. Not knowing any better, I dubbed this place the “House of Green Shoes”, naming it after the unusual amount of footwear that had been discarded inside. This is the name under which one of these photos originally appeared on this site in 2014. View Image Details Discarded video game machines litter the interior. There’s a cramped balcony level up there, if you look closely. Fast forward to 2017. While perusing old posts I breezed by the original version of this piece with its single photograph and unresolved mystery. Stopping to take a closer look, my eyes widened in surprise, as I immediately recognized the distinctive pattern of staggered holes on the projection room. I wouldn’t have known about it while I was there—but those notches were cut for twin projectors. This place was formerly a movie theater! View Image Details This is the only photo previously shared here. Initially I thought it was just a room full of junk, but now that I’ve made many forays into the abandoned theaters of Taiwan the telltale signs of the projection room on the far wall are unmistakable. View Image Details Inside what remains of the projection room. At the time I just assumed someone had been living up here—and maybe some had been! A closer look at the photos I shot revealed the name of the theater—which was there all along, written on the mirror outside the entrance—but not much of its history 1 . Obviously it was built for the many miners who used to work in these mountains, an assumption corroborated by a lone article 2 mentioning the theater by name. I’d wager it was a mining company theater, probably built in the mid-1960s with the opening of the New Pingxi Coal Mine (新平溪煤礦), now the Taiwan Coal Mine Museum (台灣煤礦博物館). That article mentions the theater has been “abandoned” for 50 years (已廢棄約五十年), but perhaps that’s when it was built . Most of the mines in this part of Taiwan closed in the late 1980s, with the very last going out of business in 1997, so it’s reasonable to assume this theater likely shut down in the early 1990s at the very latest. I strongly suspect it was operated by the mining company itself so there’s always a chance they were showing films long into the twilight of mining operations. I’ve uncovered only a handful of references to this old theater online. Two of the better articles (with more information about Shifen in general) can be found here and here , but neither of these contain additional information about the old theater. View Image Details The exterior of Luxing Theater in March 2023. I revisited this theater in March 2023, nearly a decade after I first stumbled upon it, completely ignorant of what I had found. This time around I was armed with some foreknowledge, as Josh Ellis had informed me about the state of the interior. Some effort has obviously been undertaken to clean out much of the building—gone were all the video game consoles, discarded shoes, and plenty of other junk. Some of the wooden paneling had also been stripped from the base of the projection room. And there was no sign of the mirror emblazoned with the name of the theater that I, with some serendipity, happened to photograph on my first visit. Any newcomer to the site would find it impossible to name this place based on physical evidence alone. View Image Details A closer look at the heavily weathered ticket booth. View Image Details Looking back at the projection room, supported only by a pair of spindly columns. View Image Details A green glow pervades the former seating area, which is now heavily overgrown. Although much of the front of the theater had been tidied up, nature had other ideas for the area at the back. Here the rooftop collapsed, and with sunlight streaming in, plant life had colonized much of the former seating area. While most Taiwanese cinemas of this vintage had fully vaulted roofing, this one is a peculiar hybrid of reinforced concrete, with only the last third of the structure open to the elements. At this point it would still be possible to restore the building and transform it into a tourist attraction of some kind, but I’ve seen no indication such a fate has been contemplated by the townspeople. For reference, here’s the original photo I posted, from back when I was much less disciplined with post-processing… View Image Details An abandoned building in Pingxi filled with green shoes and fake plastic flowers. Here I’ll sign off by echoing my original sentiments about the “house of the green shoes”: it truly was the first of many more explorations to come. Initially I transcribed the characters on the mirror as Lóngxìng Theater 隆興戲院, which agreed with other sources I consulted on the web. More recently local history buffs surmised that the theater was actually named after one of the landlord’s six sons (or rather, to encourage those six songs to bring riches to the family), and the first character most of us had identified was not quite right. For reference, this thread on Facebook is where the correction was made, and it was later backed up by The Thief of Places , and, if you dig a little more, a comment on this video from someone claiming to be a grandchild of the founder. ↩ Now offline and long lost, unfortunately. ↩

While most Taiwanese cinemas of this vintage had fully vaulted roofing, this one is a peculiar hybrid of reinforced concrete, with only the last third of the structure open to the elements. At this point it would still be possible to restore the building and transform it into a tourist attraction of some kind, but I’ve seen no indication such a fate has been contemplated by the townspeople. For reference, here’s the original photo I posted, from back when I was much less disciplined with post-processing… View Image Details An abandoned building in Pingxi filled with green shoes and fake plastic flowers. Here I’ll sign off by echoing my original sentiments about the “house of the green shoes”: it truly was the first of many more explorations to come. Initially I transcribed the characters on the mirror as Lóngxìng Theater 隆興戲院, which agreed with other sources I consulted on the web. More recently local history buffs surmised that the theater was actually named after one of the landlord’s six sons (or rather, to encourage those six songs to bring riches to the family), and the first character most of us had identified was not quite right. For reference, this thread on Facebook is where the correction was made, and it was later backed up by The Thief of Places , and, if you dig a little more, a comment on this video from someone claiming to be a grandchild of the founder. ↩ Now offline and long lost, unfortunately. ↩

Yìxīn Vocational High School (益新工商職業學校) is a relatively obscure but not entirely unknown ruin in central Taiwan .

It is set on an angle a little ways from the main road. Turning to the rumor mill of PTT , netizens suggest the school was already plagued by low enrollment, a common problem in Taiwan , and its closure after 921 may have been incidental. Official records are scant, possibly because this school was a branch of the much larger Da-Cheng Vocational High School ( 大成高級商工職業學校 ) in nearby Huwei.

URL: https://spectralcodex.com/dongping-tobacco-barn/
Only traces remain of the tobacco cultivation and manufacturing industry in Taichung , Taiwan . For the better part of a century tobacco was cultivated across wide swathes of the Taichung Basin 台中盆地 , cured on location, sold at regional marketplaces, and shipped to factories for further processing into cigarettes and other tobacco products. Taiwan’s accession to the WTO in 2002 marked the end of domestic tobacco production but the industry was already in steep decline, a consequence of globalization and the end of the government monopoly system in preceding decades. Several buildings related to Taichung’s tobacco industry have earned heritage status in recent years—but this decaying tobacco barn hidden down an laneway in Taiping , a suburban district on the eastern side of the burgeoning metropolis, is not among them. View Image Details An old tobacco barn hidden down a small laneway in eastern Taichung. View Image Details Around back at the old tobacco barn off Dongping Road. The rooftop has collapsed on the far side. View Image Details Little effort has been spared to protect this relic from the elements. View Image Details Facing the ruins of an old tobacco barn just off Dongping Road. View Image Details The old tobacco barn is still used for storage. There’s even a car parked under the awning on the far side. Tobacco barns once numbered in the hundreds in the Taichung Basin. Just about any family in the tobacco cultivation business built one on location, often as an extension of their existing residence, in order to cure tobacco before sending it to market. This particular tobacco barn is located only a short distance from the Taiping Tobacco Market 太平買菸場 , recently declared a historic property and presently undergoing restoration. From there tobacco would have been shipped to one of several factories around the country—although in this case we can be reasonably sure the destination would have been the Taichung Tobacco Factory 台中菸葉廠 , originally built during the Japanase colonial era in Dali , another suburban district to the south of Taiping , and still in business processing imported tobacco. View Image Details The gateway to the curing chamber. Ordinarily this would be a heavier door to keep the heat trapped inside. This might have been a late addition. View Image Details Light seeps into the curing chamber. The walls are lined with wooden shelves that would have accommodated the poles from which the tobacco was hanged to cure.

View Image Details The inside of the curing chamber is filled with suggestive clues. Was that little window used to observe the curing process? I outlined much of the process of curing tobacco in my post about the Shuinan Tobacco Barn 水湳菸樓 , the only officially protected tobacco barn in Taichung and also my introduction to learning about the tobacco industry in central Taiwan. In short, each curing chamber is filled with tobacco leaves draped from bamboo rods and then heated from below, usually by a wood-fired stove, for about a week to ready them for human consumption.

Xiluo is a small historic town on the south bank of the Zhuóshuǐ River 濁水溪 in Yunlin . It emerged as an important center of trade in central Taiwan during the Qing dynasty era and continued to prosper into the early 20th century under Japanese colonial rule . Disaster struck in 1935 when the devastating Hsinchu-Taichung Earthquake ripped through north-central Taiwan, reducing much of Xiluo to rubble. Colonial authorities and the local gentry worked together to rebuild, taking the opportunity to completely remodel the main commercial thoroughfares with an intriguing blend of influences from Baroque Revival , Art Deco , and Modernist architecture. A short stroll down Yánpíng Old Street 延平老街 reveals that many of these unique shophouses and commercial buildings remain standing today. View Image Details A row of old buildings in Xiluo. View Image Details Colonial storefronts in Xiluo. Many “old streets” in Taiwan have the contrived carnivalesque atmosphere of a night market—which, although fun at times, tends to obscure whatever sense of history might be experienced in a given place. It is difficult to get lost in a moment when you’re surrounded by vendors hawking snacks and souvenirs but sleepy Xiluo appears to have done little to attract this sort of mass tourism. In fact, apart from some inoffensive shops located in the renovated East Market 東市場 (built in the 1950s, despite appearances, and recently revitalized ) there is little to suggest that anything has changed in decades.

If you’re interested in Taiwanese cinema it is absolutely essential that you undertake a pilgrimage to this rare and special theater; it has been designated a heritage property but its future is uncertain.

Beigang Theater ( 北港劇場 ) in Beigang , Yunlin , is among the finest and most well-preserved of Taiwan’s remaining Japanese colonial era theaters. Built in 1937 with investment from a local businessman by the name of Tsai Yu-Hu ( 蔡裕斛 ), this three storey theater featured a revolving stage , seating for 800 guests, and simple western-style facade with a trace of the Baroque Revival architecture popular at the time. It was not only a cinema—Taiwanese opera, glove puppet shows , musical concerts, wedding banquets, and other events were also held inside. The theater went out of business in 1988 and was converted for use as a department store and restaurant for some time thereafter. Nowadays it is apparently still in use as a pool hall and, inexplicably, a kidney dialysis center, but I saw no evidence of this when I visited in the summer of 2017. View Image Details Beigang Theater is still in great shape despite being repurposed and disused for the better part of three decades. View Image Details A closer look at the front of the old theater reveals several minor details. Note the character in the center of the ring at top; this is the family name of the original investor. Also note the mounting points for four square plates; these would have once displayed the name of the theater. Beigang was formerly home to four theaters of which this is the second. For this reason it was generally known as New Theater (新戲園) back in the day. The nearby Dàfù Theater ( 大復戲院 ), which dates back to 1927, was designated a heritage building in 2009 and is presently undergoing a costly restoration process . Despite its obvious historic and cultural value Beigang Theater itself is not yet protected by law, and I’ve not seen anything that would suggest this process is moving forward. I’d guess this has more to do with resistance by the current owners than a lack of interest on behalf of the Ministry of Culture . For an excellent overview of theater history in Beigang I recommend this post (in Chinese) and accompanying video by Yú Fū (魚夫), in mixed Taiwanese and Mandarin. View Image Details An oblique look at the old theater in the cramped streets on the north side of Beigang. View Image Details Around back at the old Beigang Theater. Somewhat surprisingly I haven’t found too many posts about this classic theater. For vintage photos and more information in Chinese try following these links: here , here , and here .

People’s Park In The Sky is a peculiar attraction located about 60 kilometers south of Manila in Tagaytay , a popular leisure destination in the province of Cavite in the Philippines . Perched on top of Mount Sungay at an elevation of 709 meters, the highest point on the northern rim of the immense Taal Caldera , it was originally planned to be a palace suitable for state visits during the kleptocratic reign of Ferdinand Marcos . Construction began in 1979 with a drastic leveling of the mountaintop, which previously reached 759 meters, but ground to a halt with increasing civic unrest and the cancellation of Ronald Reagan’s state visit in 1983 . Following the People Power Revolution of 1986 the unfinished mansion was transformed into a public park and monument to the greed, corruption, and excess of the Marcos era .

Xiluo Bridge (西螺大橋) spans the mighty Zhuóshuǐ River (濁水溪), the unofficial boundary between north and south Taiwan , connecting the counties of Changhua and Yunlin . Construction began in 1937 under Japanese colonial rule but came to a halt after the attack on Pearl Harbor as the allotted steel was needed for the war effort. In 1952 the bridge was completed under the incoming Chinese Nationalist government with American steel and financial aid . At 1,939 meters in length it was one of the longest bridges in the world when it was finished—second only to the Golden Gate Bridge at that time—and became such a source of national pride that it appeared on Taiwanese bank notes (specifically 第一套橫式新臺幣 ) and stamps in the 1960s. Originally it was equipped with sugar railway tracks but these have been removed and nowadays only light road traffic is permitted to cross the bridge. View Image Details Xiluo Bridge, the gateway to Yunlin County. Notice the plaques on the inside of the struts on either side? The left bears an imprint of the American steel manufacturer; the right is a plaque signifying Chinese-American cooperation. View Image Details At nearly two kilometers in length this was one of the longest bridges in the world when it was built. The seal at top left is that of Chen Cheng ( 陳誠 ), former Premier of the Republic of China. View Image Details Crossing the mighty Zhoushui River beneath the distinctive red trusses of the Xiluo Bridge. View Image Details Looking north along the length of Xiluo Bridge from Yunlin County. On the left you can see the outline of the Xizhou Recycling Plant ( 溪州資源回收場 ) in Changhua. I became interested in Xiluo Bridge after seeing in pictures and reading a little about its history online. I made my first crossing at night while riding a bicycle from Tainan to Changhua . Not long thereafter I returned to Xiluo and crossed by day. It is a beautiful and refreshing ride across the broad alluvial plains and it isn’t so highly trafficked that you cannot stop along the way and admire the scenery framed by the distinctive red steel structure of the Warren trusses . View Image Details Red and blue converge across the broad floodplains. View Image Details Reflections of the Changhua terminus of the Xiluo Bridge. By night the southern terminus of the Xiluo Bridge comes alive with the sound of music and the sight of dozens of locals enjoying a night on the riverbank. There are tables, chairs, and other places to sit, several mobile cafes selling drinks and snack, and a stage setup for bands and karaoke. I can’t say whether this is a regular occurrence or not but I saw crowds along the riverbank on more than one occasion so I would imagine it’s fairly commonplace. Xiluo retains a distinctly vintage vibe and these gatherings feel like a throwback to simpler times in the town of swords and vegetables . And, as luck would have it, this beautiful old bridge was declared a historic site in the 2000s, so there are no plans to tear it down. Something of the past will live on. View Image Details A plaque for the Sino-American Cooperation Organization ( 中美合作 ) near the south end of the bridge. SACO had already dissolved by this point and the Chinese contributed almost nothing to the construction of the bridge; the pylons are Japanese and the steel is American. There are many posts about this historic bridge in the Chinese language blogosphere; for a small sampling try here , here , here , and here .

View Image Details A betel nut stand in front of the train station in Shuili. Recently I stopped in Shuili while on my way to Puli by scooter. There, while waiting out a rainstorm on the main street in front of the historic train station , I noticed an unusual betel nut booth with a fetching green sign. “Chinese chewing gum” is a curious phrase, not one I recall noticing before, and it is also peculiar to see an exclusively English sign out here in the mountainous heart of the nation. Searching around, I chanced upon a short documentary describing betel nut as Taiwan chewing gum , which still sounds somewhat odd. What sort of gum gets you high and stains your teeth red?

Xiluo is justifiably famous for Xiluo Theater , the Japanese colonial era theater located close to the architectural wonders of Yánpíng Old Street 延平老街 , but this small town on the south bank of the sluggish Zhuóshuǐ River 濁水溪 was once home to two additional theaters . Almost no mention of these other theaters can be found except in this news report about a local painter—but while browsing around satellite view on Google Maps I managed to locate Huáshēng Theater 華聲戲院 (also known as Yīshēng Theater 一生戲院). View Image Details The bland, utilitarian appearance of this old theater in Xiluo is consistent with the architectural trends of the KMT authoritarian era. The metal frames mounted on the front would have once held hand-painted movie posters. The process of identifying Yisheng Theater was not straight-forward. Most of the characters on the facade are missing, introducing considerable ambiguity. A closer examination of the metal brackets that once secured the mystery characters was not conclusive. Both sources cited above cite three theaters in town: the famous Xiluo Theater and two lesser known theaters, Yuǎndōng Theater 遠東戲院 (“Far East Theater”) and Yisheng. Initially I figured this must be Yuandong Theater, for the pattern of corrosion and placement of the metal brackets suggest a full-sized character in the first position, but that was incorrect. At an exhibition of the photography of Lee Kai-Ming 李開明 at Huashan Creative Park in November 2017 I noticed he had identified a completely different building as Yuandong Theater. By a process of elimination—assuming there were indeed only three theaters in town—this must be Huasheng Theater 1 .

The door is wide open but you’ll find only dust and footprints in here. View Image Details One last look at another abandoned theater in central Taiwan. Huasheng Theater was established in 1979 and probably went out of business in the 1990s like many other standalone theaters in central Taiwan. Evidently it was converted for use as a discount supermarket and perhaps a gambling den or seedy karaoke bar at some point, for the interior has been renovated to remove all traces of the projection room, ticket booth, and other fixtures of movie theater design. I wandered around inside for a little while but there was nothing to see—it is merely a dark and hollow shell, not at all interesting. Well, they can’t all be cool, but this one is on the rental market. Anyone fancy a use for this ugly old theater in Xiluo? One last note: while the theater was open and accessible on my first visit it was closed the second time I stopped by to confirm the name. At the time I was asking about Yisheng Theater, which probably sounded close enough for confirmation. ↩

Recently I wrote about the Liùjiǎo Brick Kiln 六腳磚窯 , an obscure abandonment in rural Chiayi , Taiwan . While attempting to find out more about that kiln I found a reference to a second abandoned kiln in the area, the Shuāngxīkǒu Brick Kiln 雙溪口磚窯, informally named after the closest village in neighboring Puzi . Weeks after visiting the first kiln I returned to scope out the second and—insofar as I can tell—only other remaining brick kiln in this expanse of the Chianan Plain 嘉南平原 . It was a hazy, grey day out there so these photos aren’t nearly as nice as those of the other kiln, but in the interest of adding a little something to the historic record I’m sharing them here anyway. View Image Details The brick kiln’s chimney still towers over the rice paddies of this part of rural Chiayi. View Image Details Totally overgrown and not so photogenic. The design of this kiln is almost identical to that of the nearby Liujiao Brick Kiln so I highly recommend reading that piece for a basic introduction. Both kilns are eye kilns (mùzǐyáo 目仔窯), presumably a variation on the classic climbing kiln (dēngyáo 登窯), which is ordinarily built on a slope to take advantage of the tendency for hot gas to rise (and therefore move through the length of the kiln). Few slopes exist in the lowlands of Chiayi so these kilns employ chimneys (or flues , to be technical about it) to create the pressure differential that pulls hot gas from one end of the kiln to the other. There are, however, two ways in which these kilns appear to differ: this one has a much taller chimney and seems to have been built on a slight incline. All other things being equal, this would imply that the kiln in Shuangxikou was more fuel-efficient than the one in Liujiao, with its shorter chimney and lack of any noticeable slope. View Image Details Two eyes of the old kiln. Unlike the Liujiao Brick Kiln some evidence of a rising slope from right to left can be seen here. View Image Details Peering straight through an eye of the kiln to the other side. View Image Details Braving the mosquitoes for a closer look at the construction of an individual kiln chamber. Note the ventilation holes at ground level. I haven’t been able to find any credible information about the histories of either kiln but it’s a safe bet both operated during the booming decades of the Taiwan economic miracle from the 1960s to the 1980s much like some other kilns I’ve written about. The eye kiln design harkens back to the Japanese colonial era but the chimney is almost certainly a product of the post-war period. There’s a chance a new chimney was constructed after these kilns were in operation but my guess is that they’re nowhere near as old as their more famous eye kiln cousins in Yilan and Jiji 1 . View Image Details Portal to the beekeeper’s realm. View Image Details An ad hoc apiary in the ruins of a brick kiln in rural Chiayi. Whereas the kiln in Liujiao is used for storage by the adjacent housing complex this kiln is far from any residence. Some enterprising local has taken advantage of the shelter afforded by the bulk of the kiln to open an apiary—a place where honey bees are kept. You can imagine my surprise when I pulled up, shut off the engine, and heard the incessant drone of thousands of bees busy at work. Since I am still not entirely sure whether I am allergic to beestings or not I declined to get too close to the hives. View Image Details The chimney towers over the surrounding landscape of rice paddies. Neither kiln is likely to be conserved but there is a small chance this particular kiln may end up attracting the attention of policymakers in government. Shuangxikou Brick Kiln is quite close to the newly opened Southern Branch of the National Palace Museum 國立故宮博物院南部院區 and Zhèchéng Cultural Park 蔗埕文化園區 , which occupies the grounds of the old Suàntóu Sugar Factory 蒜頭糖廠. Both are well-integrated with the high-speed rail station and there is talk of creating a link with the old sugar railway network. If these ventures are successful in attracting more tourists to the area perhaps there will be some interest in restoring this kiln and including it on tours. Personally I find it much more interesting to visit the original sites of traditional industries rather than see a sanitized version in a museum setting—but I realize there’s only so much funding and interest to go around. So there you have it: another exceedingly obscure remnant of a traditional industry in Taiwan . Here I am referring to the historic Yilan Brick Kiln 宜蘭磚窯 , built in the 1930s, and the far less authentic 13 Eye Kiln 十三目仔窯 in Nantou , which was utterly destroyed by the 921 Earthquake and redeveloped into a garish tourist trap. Other kilns in Taiwan have been transformed into tourist attractions but these two are the main eye kilns that have been chosen for conservation and promotion by the tourist bureau. ↩

Recently I wrote about the Liùjiǎo Brick Kiln 六腳磚窯 , an obscure abandonment in rural Chiayi , Taiwan . While attempting to find out more about that kiln I found a reference to a second abandoned kiln in the area, the Shuāngxīkǒu Brick Kiln 雙溪口磚窯, informally named after the closest village in neighboring Puzi . Weeks after visiting the first kiln I returned to scope out the second and—insofar as I can tell—only other remaining brick kiln in this expanse of the Chianan Plain 嘉南平原 . It was a hazy, grey day out there so these photos aren’t nearly as nice as those of the other kiln, but in the interest of adding a little something to the historic record I’m sharing them here anyway. View Image Details The brick kiln’s chimney still towers over the rice paddies of this part of rural Chiayi. View Image Details Totally overgrown and not so photogenic. The design of this kiln is almost identical to that of the nearby Liujiao Brick Kiln so I highly recommend reading that piece for a basic introduction. Both kilns are eye kilns (mùzǐyáo 目仔窯), presumably a variation on the classic climbing kiln (dēngyáo 登窯), which is ordinarily built on a slope to take advantage of the tendency for hot gas to rise (and therefore move through the length of the kiln). Few slopes exist in the lowlands of Chiayi so these kilns employ chimneys (or flues , to be technical about it) to create the pressure differential that pulls hot gas from one end of the kiln to the other. There are, however, two ways in which these kilns appear to differ: this one has a much taller chimney and seems to have been built on a slight incline. All other things being equal, this would imply that the kiln in Shuangxikou was more fuel-efficient than the one in Liujiao, with its shorter chimney and lack of any noticeable slope. View Image Details Two eyes of the old kiln. Unlike the Liujiao Brick Kiln some evidence of a rising slope from right to left can be seen here. View Image Details Peering straight through an eye of the kiln to the other side. View Image Details Braving the mosquitoes for a closer look at the construction of an individual kiln chamber. Note the ventilation holes at ground level. I haven’t been able to find any credible information about the histories of either kiln but it’s a safe bet both operated during the booming decades of the Taiwan economic miracle from the 1960s to the 1980s much like some other kilns I’ve written about. The eye kiln design harkens back to the Japanese colonial era but the chimney is almost certainly a product of the post-war period. There’s a chance a new chimney was constructed after these kilns were in operation but my guess is that they’re nowhere near as old as their more famous eye kiln cousins in Yilan and Jiji 1 . View Image Details Portal to the beekeeper’s realm. View Image Details An ad hoc apiary in the ruins of a brick kiln in rural Chiayi. Whereas the kiln in Liujiao is used for storage by the adjacent housing complex this kiln is far from any residence. Some enterprising local has taken advantage of the shelter afforded by the bulk of the kiln to open an apiary—a place where honey bees are kept. You can imagine my surprise when I pulled up, shut off the engine, and heard the incessant drone of thousands of bees busy at work. Since I am still not entirely sure whether I am allergic to beestings or not I declined to get too close to the hives. View Image Details The chimney towers over the surrounding landscape of rice paddies. Neither kiln is likely to be conserved but there is a small chance this particular kiln may end up attracting the attention of policymakers in government. Shuangxikou Brick Kiln is quite close to the newly opened Southern Branch of the National Palace Museum 國立故宮博物院南部院區 and Zhèchéng Cultural Park 蔗埕文化園區 , which occupies the grounds of the old Suàntóu Sugar Factory 蒜頭糖廠. Both are well-integrated with the high-speed rail station and there is talk of creating a link with the old sugar railway network. If these ventures are successful in attracting more tourists to the area perhaps there will be some interest in restoring this kiln and including it on tours. Personally I find it much more interesting to visit the original sites of traditional industries rather than see a sanitized version in a museum setting—but I realize there’s only so much funding and interest to go around. So there you have it: another exceedingly obscure remnant of a traditional industry in Taiwan .

Despite its relative obscurity Xinying is the largest settlement along the railway line between metropolitan Tainan City and Chiayi City . It was the capital of Tainan County prior to amalgamation in 2010 and remains the secondary administrative seat of Tainan . Located on the broad and fertile Chianan Plain , it was also an important transportation hub for the sugar industry , and what remains of the Japanese colonial era sugar factory can still be found on the south side of town. Xinying was also home to half a dozen standalone movie theaters in its heyday, but most have since been demolished.

Old entertainment districts are typically located in the vicinity of the main train station in small to mid-sized Taiwanese cities like Xinying but the sugar factory, with its thousands of workers, pulled the economic center of gravity to the southwest. All six golden age theaters in town were located in the area just north of a bridge leading over the sugar railway tracks from the factory itself 1 .

Liùjiǎo Brick Kiln 六腳磚窯 was an unexpected discovery while riding from Beigang to Puzi earlier this summer. The chimney is plainly visible from the roadside and the crumbling bulk of the kiln can be discerned in a gap between the row of houses out front. Stopping to take a closer look I went around (and through) the old kiln to document what remains. Liujiao is a rather obscure part of rural Chiayi so I’ve not found any mention of this place online apart from this brief post . Whereas several kilns in various other parts of Taiwan are being preserved this obscure ruin is almost certainly never going to be the object of a conservation effort. View Image Details The crumbling ruins of an old brick kiln in rural Chiayi County. View Image Details Every chamber is connected to the next. Without any credible information online I have no idea how old this kiln might be. After some research I’ve established this kind of brick kiln is generally known as a climbing kiln (dēngyáo 登窯), ladder kiln (jiētīyáo 階梯窯), or eye kiln (mùzǐyáo 目仔窯). Climbing kilns are generally built on a slope and, if I’m not mistaken, a ladder kiln is just another name for climbing kiln. Since this kiln is built on more or less flat land—this being part of the broad expanse of the Chianan Plain 嘉南平原 —I surmise that “eye kiln” would be the most accurate description. It is very similar in design to the more well-known Yilan Brick Kiln 宜蘭磚窯 ( 中文 ), which was built in 1930. Hoffmann kilns , typified by this example from Changhua , were more common in the KMT authoritarian era , but any estimate of age would be pure guesswork on my part. View Image Details Much of the old kiln is totally overgrown. Escaping the fierce tropical sun for a moment I stepped inside a few chambers for a quick look around. The most immediate thing I noticed—after the rapacity of the mosquitoes concealed within—was the row of holes at ground level in each chamber. Presumably these provided ventilation so hot air could flow from once chamber to the next. I’m still somewhat unclear on the operation of the kiln but I believe each entrance is sealed during regular operation—and hot gas flows from the tail end of the kiln toward the chimney, heating all the bricks along the way. View Image Details Many of the chambers have collapsed, exposing the interior to the elements. View Image Details Notice the holes at ground level? Probably ventilation. View Image Details Local residents use many chambers for storage. View Image Details Imagine growing up with a brick kiln in your backyard! Apart from the somewhat modern row of houses out front there wasn’t too much more to see apart from a dry pond near the chimney. Most brick kilns are built near a supply of water but I’m not entirely sure where the clay would have come from; it’s a very small pond. Amusingly enough, the kiln is used for storage by some residents. Imagine growing up with this crumbling ruin in your backyard—and almost nothing but idyllic rice paddies all around. View Image Details Smoke stack on the horizon. It’s the tallest thing around and quite hard to miss. After returning from my trip I attempted to find out more about this kiln but came up mostly empty. I did, however, read about another kiln in the area —the Shuāngxīkǒu Brick Kiln 雙溪口磚窯 in neighboring Puzi . It is almost identical to this kiln with some small differences I mention in my full post about it. As for conservation status, there’s almost no chance this old kiln in Liujiao will be restored. Not everything is special enough to preserve in anything other than photographs.

One of the last of the many vintage theaters of Tainan seems to have finally closed its doors. Founded in 1964, the notorious Xīnjiànguó Theater 新建國戲院 was originally named for its location on Jianguo Road 建國路, which was later renamed Mínquán Road 民權路 . It is not uncommon for old theaters in Taiwan to resort to showing pornography in the twilight of their decline but this particular theater appears to have specialized in more carnal forms of entertainment for much of its history. Perhaps this is why this theater remained in business until very recently—long after most of the nation’s hundreds of other standalone theaters shut down in the late 1990s and early 2000s. View Image Details A huge red signboard conceals most of the front of this rundown old theater near the train station in Tainan. View Image Details The vintage style of the ticket booth in front of Xinjianguo Theater in Tainan. 200 NT and you could hang out here all day. Much of what I’ve read about this theater online is pretty much what you’d expect: nostalgic anecdotes recounted with some sense of embarrassment, cruising reports on queer message forums, and occasional references in posts about local theater history . It also appears in this quaint illustration in a book about the old shops of Tainan . The blood red signboard has become an iconic feature of Tainan’s collective memory. View Image Details Last of the smut. View Image Details Now playing: nothing at all. As for my own experience of this theater, I actually lived around the corner back in 2014 but hadn’t yet taken an active interest in documenting the decline of Taiwanese cinema . I faintly recall cycling by and noting the advanced age of most patrons milling around out front but not much beyond that. Only in 2017 did I return, armed with my camera and the vague intention of sneaking inside for a look, but that moment is gone, lost forever. View Image Details From this angle you can faintly discern the original facade and lettering. I returned in 2018 on a much nicer day, intent on taking a closer look at the old theater. Not much had changed, though if you look closely you might notice a poster missing from the left side of the ticket booth. This time around I noticed the big signboard is mounted low enough that you can see something of the original facade from across the street. It’s tricky to make out but there’s a circular logo in the middle—and the original name of the theater is written right-to-left on the left-hand side of the building! View Image Details A closer look at the rusty old neon sign protruding from the top of the old theater. View Image Details One last glance at the last standalone theater in the city. I wonder what the future might hold for this old cinema? Despite its sordid history it strikes me as a great candidate for restoration and repurposing. The location is fantastic: very close to the train station, fashion district, and many tourist attractions. And I’m guessing the original facade will end up looking quite stylish, however drab and utilitarian it might be. Chances are it’ll be demolished before we find out, but who knows? I’ll keep an eye out for any news about this theater and will update this post accordingly.

Much of what I’ve read about this theater online is pretty much what you’d expect: nostalgic anecdotes recounted with some sense of embarrassment, cruising reports on queer message forums, and occasional references in posts about local theater history . It also appears in this quaint illustration in a book about the old shops of Tainan . The blood red signboard has become an iconic feature of Tainan’s collective memory. View Image Details Last of the smut. View Image Details Now playing: nothing at all. As for my own experience of this theater, I actually lived around the corner back in 2014 but hadn’t yet taken an active interest in documenting the decline of Taiwanese cinema . I faintly recall cycling by and noting the advanced age of most patrons milling around out front but not much beyond that. Only in 2017 did I return, armed with my camera and the vague intention of sneaking inside for a look, but that moment is gone, lost forever. View Image Details From this angle you can faintly discern the original facade and lettering. I returned in 2018 on a much nicer day, intent on taking a closer look at the old theater. Not much had changed, though if you look closely you might notice a poster missing from the left side of the ticket booth. This time around I noticed the big signboard is mounted low enough that you can see something of the original facade from across the street. It’s tricky to make out but there’s a circular logo in the middle—and the original name of the theater is written right-to-left on the left-hand side of the building! View Image Details A closer look at the rusty old neon sign protruding from the top of the old theater. View Image Details One last glance at the last standalone theater in the city. I wonder what the future might hold for this old cinema? Despite its sordid history it strikes me as a great candidate for restoration and repurposing. The location is fantastic: very close to the train station, fashion district, and many tourist attractions. And I’m guessing the original facade will end up looking quite stylish, however drab and utilitarian it might be. Chances are it’ll be demolished before we find out, but who knows? I’ll keep an eye out for any news about this theater and will update this post accordingly.

The obscure Lìzé Theater 利澤戲院 is located in the village of Lìzéjiǎn 利澤簡 in Wujie , a rural township just east of Luodong in Yilan , Taiwan . Built in 1964, it once served as a cinema and playhouse, hosting a variety of films and live theater performances for the local populace before slipping into decline in the 1980s, a little earlier than most other theaters I’ve visited around the nation. Afterwards the theater was converted for use as a clothing factory but this also went out of business. Nowadays the building is more disused than abandoned , as descendants of the original owner are still making use of the structure for storage and other purposes. In a stroke of good luck I happened to visit while the door was open—and after communicating my interest in the history of old theaters in Taiwan I was invited in for a brief chat and look around. Each theater has its own story to tell—but in this case I was particularly interested in learning why a theater was built in such a small and seemingly unimportant village. View Image Details The 1960s vintage Lize Theater from across the street. View Image Details A vintage movie poster and some very old school prices adorn the ticket booth of the old theater. Although you wouldn’t know it by walking the length of the somnolent Lìzéjiǎn Old Street 利澤簡老街 today, Lizejian 1 prospered as an important transshipment port in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The village is now located some distance from a bend in the Dōngshān River 冬山河 (now a popular park ) but the northern end of the old street—where the theater is now located—was once right on the water . Sheltered from the sea by coastal dunes and a bend in the river , Lizejian was second in importance only to Wūshí Port 烏石港 in Yilan during the Qing dynasty era . View Image Details A rare peek inside the old theater building. It was converted into a clothing factory some time ago and is no longer actively used for much more than storage. The town continued to prosper in the early Japanese colonial era , leading to the establishment of Lìshēng Hospital 利生醫院 in 1920. This beautiful western-style building houses a clinic that is still in operation today. It was actually through reading this excellent blog about the hospital that I first learned of the existence of this theater, which is immediately across the street. At a glance one might assume both buildings were constructed around the same time—but more than four decades of history separate the two. Lizejian’s star began to fade with the arrival of the railway in nearby Luodong in 1919. Subsequent decades brought about the silting of the harbour, extensive flood-prevention projects along the riverbanks, and, by the late 1960s, the development of Su'ao into a major port . In this sense the construction of Lize Theater in the twilight of the town’s prosperity represents the ending of an era, not the beginning of a new one. View Image Details Looking back from inside the theater one can discern a balcony over the entrance—and the side of what was once the projection room. View Image Details An old red seat discarded at the side of the room. View Image Details A more recent banner emblazoned with the name of the theater. View Image Details A vintage poster for Formosa oolong tea. Somewhat random. View Image Details Around back at the old theater in a small village in Wujie. In recent years as domestic tourism has grown in Taiwan some effort has been undertaken to promote Lizejian as a leisure destination. As such, the exterior of the old theater has occasionally been tidied up, and sometimes even decorated with banners harkening back to the old days. It has also seen some use as a filming location, though the hospital across the street is often the focus of those efforts. Despite growing interest in preserving heritage properties in Taiwan the fate of this classic theater is far from certain. As with many other family-owned businesses in Taiwan there appears to be little agreement among the descendants about what to do with the property. Unlike the hospital across the street is isn’t recognized as a heritage property and, as such, may be freely renovated or demolished, as was planned back in 2012 . But from what I understand of the conversation with the man inside the theater at least some of the current owners would rather find a new use for the old theater than tear it down. View Image Details One can faintly discern the name of the old theater on the sign out front. If you’re curious to read more about this small piece of Yilan history, Lizejian Old Street is the subject of many Chinese-language blogs, for example here , here , here , and here . I’ve sprinkled informative links throughout the post but if you’d like to read the best write-ups about local history I suggest perusing here , here , here , and here (all in Chinese, of course). Lizejian, as with many place names in Taiwan, ultimately derives from an Indigenous place name. In this case it was originally a settlement of the seafaring Kavalan People 噶瑪蘭族 known as Hedecanan, which apparently means “resting place” in their language (and perhaps “the place where the ships rest”). The first Hokkien -speaking settlers adapted this name into their own language without standardizing what characters were used until much later. As such, the port and settlement on the south bank of what was then known as Ka-lé-óan-káng 加禮宛港 (from “Kalewan” in the Kavalan language; with “káng” meaning “wide stream” as well as “port”) was often rendered as Kî-le̍k-káng 奇力港 (though I’ve also seen variations like 奇力簡 and 里德幹 floating around). Later on this was standardized as Lī-te̍k-kán 利澤簡, possibly as a result of some homonymy between kán 簡 and káng 港 in Hokkien. Most of this is just guess work, mind you; I’ve mostly been messing around with this Chinese-Taiwanese dictionary to try and piece together how Hedecanan became Lizejian.

Taiwan is riddled with failed construction projects, monuments to avarice, incompetence, and bureaucracy. Building defects , mismanagement, and land ownership disputes are common causes, but legal battles, limited funding for costly demolitions, and a lack of political often ensure such projects remain a blight on the urban landscape of the nation. One such project can be found along Wànshòu Road 萬壽路 at the western margins of the Taipei Basin 台北盆地 not far from Huilong Station 迴龍站 , terminus of the orange line of the Taipei MRT in Xinzhuang, New Taipei . Technically this abandonment is located within Guishan , for the district boundary sweeps down from the hills and loops around a mostly industrial area sprawling along a small valley leading the rest of the way to the flatlands of the basin. Given that this road is one of the main arteries connecting Taoyuan with Taipei these twin 17-storey towers, typically identified as the Wanshou Road Residential Ruins 萬壽路廢棄社區, are regularly the subject of inquiries on PTT and other parts of the Taiwanese internet . View Image Details In front of an abandoned residential tower on the edge of the Taipei Basin. View Image Details Creeping into the entrance of the abandoned residential complex along Wanshou Road. Before I dig in to what little I have found about these ruins I’d like to make a small note about the location. Wanshou Road sweeps through the rugged hills along the southern slope of the Linkou Plateau 林口台地 , closely following a section of the original Qing dynasty era railway built in 1891 at the behest of forward-thinking governor Liú Míngchuán 劉銘傳 . The Japanese invaded only a few years later and, after surveying their new acquisition, opted to reroute the Main Line 縱貫線 along the Dàhàn River 大漢溪 to the south, avoiding the steep grades of the more direct route through the hills to ease the burden of the steam locomotives still in use in those days. View Image Details The inner courtyard is overgrown, but not as much as one would expect from 20 years of neglect. Now let’s move ahead by a century. These residential towers were allegedly built in 1993 but construction came to a standstill after the developers failed to secure an operating license. It sounds crazy to me but apparently the process is “build first, apply for a permit later”, and in this case the application was rejected after it was revealed that the developers had built these towers on government-owned land . The rest of the story is hazy but I suppose the development company folded under mounting debts and the inability to legally sell any of the units they had built, leaving the fate of these buildings in the hands of a local government disinterested in footing the bill for demolition. More than two decades later I haven’t found any news reports suggesting anything will be done about these towering eyesores. View Image Details Looking up from the inner courtyard it isn’t obvious that the entire complex was never finished. I haven’t much to say about my walk around the property itself. Gaining access to the area immediately around the towers is a piece of cake but the upper floors are protected by what appears to be an active security system. Several of the ground floor units show evidence of habitation, though it doesn’t appear as if anyone has been squatting here for quite some time. There is some evidence the ground floor units may have been used as a KTV at one point—why else would there be a “VIP room”, I wonder? But the interior spaces readily open to exploration are almost all empty rooms coated in dust and filled with the odd piece of trash. If you’re keen on climbing to the top I would imagine it’s doable—but I was only breezing through, bound for more historic ruins just down the road. View Image Details Another view from within the failed project. Given the Taiwanese propensity for ghost stories it isn’t surprising that these buildings have become a destination for supernatural thrill-seekers and urban explorers alike. I actually found out about this place through this set of photos and video walkthrough posted by 夜遊台灣 (incidentally the same group referenced in this post about how my work was misrepresented by Taiwanese media). I also uncovered this batch of photos and a report from 鬼故事夜遊團 while researching this post. From what I’ve read the stretch of roadway around these abandoned towers is frequently the scene of car accidents —and wouldn’t you know it, but I actually witnessed a minor collision while investigating the old railway bridge a little up the hill. A mysterious ruin along a stretch of highway notorious for fatal accidents? The ghost story practically writes itself! But I find it far more interesting to imagine a European steam engine chugging up this same incline a hundred years ago… View Image Details The abandoned residential complex from the roadside. It is absolutely impossible to miss. Anyhow, this ruin has little in the way of historic or aesthetic value and it is by no means unexplored. It is for these reasons that I haven’t gone to great lengths to obscure the location. These days I am more conscious of how the information presented here on my blog is used by others—but this place is already widely known and isn’t really worth preserving. Keep an eye out for security and the watchful eyes of nearby street vendors if you happen to pay it a visit. And if you’re also keen on local history there’s a bridge dating back to the Qing dynasty a little up the road—but you’ll have to find a way down to the river bed to appreciate the stone arch beneath the modern roadway, or just wait for a future post.

View Image Details Out front at Binh Tay Market in Ho Chi Minh City’s historic Chinatown. This week I am visiting Ho Chi Minh City , Vietnam , on another side trip from Taiwan . Six months ago I visited Hanoi and enjoyed my time there—check out this photo gallery for a comprehensive overview—so I’m hoping to repeat the experience in the emerging megacity further south. My first walkabout brought me to District 5 in search of Cholon , HCMC’s historic Chinatown , which was originally a settlement separate from colonial Saigon. Cholon literally means “Big Market” so I made a point of visiting Binh Tay Market (Vietnamese: Chợ Bình Tây), which is just over the border in District 6 . Along the way I noticed many temporary structures along the roadway so it was no great surprise to discover the famous market closed for what I would assume is renovation. View Image Details A glimpse inside the closed Binh Tay Market. I tried climbing the stairs but was called back by security. Oh well, it was worth a try! Since the gateway to the market wasn’t sealed I decided to try waltzing in—and was immediately stopped and waved away by a big group of workers all crowded around a table, presumably breaking for lunch. After pointing at my camera they allowed me to snap a few photos from the entrance. Of course, it’s just like me to stumble upon abandoned and disused places wherever I go, but in this case I would imagine there’s a larger plan at work. View Image Details Shuttered stalls to the left. View Image Details Rainwater reflections to the right. View Image Details A path of destruction outside the famous old market. Hopefully they aren’t knocking the whole building down, it’s rather distinctive in its design! Anyhow, there wasn’t too much to see inside the old market but I want to share at least something from this trip before time slips away. I have a tendency to go on these short side trips and never really get around to sharing much from them—but in this case I later published a series of photos from the trip as well as an extensive report on the area’s many Chinese temples. For more insight into Cholon and Binh Tay Market have a look at these posts here and here .

URL: https://spectralcodex.com/ershui-assembly-hall/
Ershui Assembly Hall 二水公會堂 is located in Ershui , a small town at the very southern edge of Changhua , on the border with both Yunlin (to the south) and Nantou (to the east). It is one of approximately 70 assembly halls built all around Taiwan to accommodate large public gatherings during the Japanese colonial era . This particular example was built in 1930 and is one of three remaining in Changhua. The other two—in Changhua City and Lukang —are both fully restored heritage properties open to the public, but the smaller Ershui Assembly Hall has been derelict for years, a consequence of a long-running legal dispute between the landlord and local government complicating preservation efforts. View Image Details A closer look at the facade. The circular outline of where the original sign would have been mounted is visible. You may also notice a moth in the frame; there were hundreds flying all around the building when I visited. The characters emblazoned on the front of the building read Zhōngshān Hall 中山堂 1 but this was not the original name. If you look closely at the photograph you can see a circular outline around the central character, almost certainly where something would have been mounted. I strongly suspect this would have been a plate inscribed with the Ershui city emblem (shìhuī 市徽), a convention outlined in a previous post about the nearby Fenyuan Town Hall . I went looking for archival footage of the hall but found nothing online to confirm this hunch. One of the benefits of conferring heritage status on a building is that at least some amount of proper research will be done—but in this case all I’ve got to go on is the work of Taiwanese bloggers also interested in local history and culture. View Image Details Creeping around the side of the derelict assembly hall. The assembly hall 2 was constructed between the older, unplanned Qing dynasty era settlement and the newer, more modern area around Ershui Station 二水車站 , which opened in 1905. This reflects a common urban planning pattern in the Japanese colonial era: grafting an area of wider streets (often on a grid) and institutional buildings ( e.g. post offices, police stations, government offices, etc.) onto an existing town 3 . As expected, the old assembly hall was constructed next to an assortment of other civic buildings, among them a police station and several wooden dormitories. Google Street View records indicate the police station was still present in 2012—so the unkempt meadowland immediately adjacent to the assembly hall has only been empty for a few years. View Image Details The side door is open for some reason, how could I not go take a look? I didn’t expect to be able to take a peek inside the old assembly hall, particularly not after jumping the fence around the side and arousing the attention of two Taiwanese men playing catch on a bare patch of ground next to the fire station, which is still in use. I put on a smile and asked if it was alright to go take a look and, after glancing at one another, the man closer to me assented with a curt nod. Stepping through the weeds, I went around back and had a look inside the assembly hall and a small wooden building with a surprisingly interesting history. View Image Details Inside the assembly hall. It doesn’t look so bad in here. View Image Details Evidently it is now used as storage by the fire department. Unbeknownst to me at the time, the wooden building behind the assembly hall originally served as an office of the Hoko system 保甲制度 , a grassroots form of civic self-governance and law enforcement adapted from the existing Baojia system . This system provided an interface between community leaders and law enforcement—which is why this old wooden building was located next to the colonial era police station. Community leaders under the Hoko system were charged with registering overnight visitors, reporting suspicious activity, and other such duties. The Hoko system was also used to reshape social customs in the early Japanese colonial period. Foot binding , a common practice in late 19th century Taiwan , was viewed by the Japanese as an uncivilized custom—and rightly so. Seeking to discourage and then outright ban the practice in the 1910s, the Japanese sent orders down through the network of Hoko offices to identify households with bound women and eventually order their unbinding 4 . View Image Details The old Hoko Office 保甲事務所 in Ershui. View Image Details Inside the old office, which was obviously repurposed since 1945. Visually there is nothing too interesting about the Hoko Office 保甲事務所, nor was there much of anything left inside. This system was abolished in 1945, not long before the beginning of the housing crisis that coincided with the KMT defeat in China , so there’s a good chance it was someone’s residence in the intervening years. Then again, it might have continued to serve another institutional function. Had I not read about it here I would have assumed it was just another police dormitory. The only thing that really stands out is the base of a flagpole constructed in the same rugged pebble-washed style (xǐshízǐ 洗石子) as the assembly hall.

Ershui Assembly Hall 二水公會堂 is located in Ershui , a small town at the very southern edge of Changhua , on the border with both Yunlin (to the south) and Nantou (to the east). It is one of approximately 70 assembly halls built all around Taiwan to accommodate large public gatherings during the Japanese colonial era . This particular example was built in 1930 and is one of three remaining in Changhua. The other two—in Changhua City and Lukang —are both fully restored heritage properties open to the public, but the smaller Ershui Assembly Hall has been derelict for years, a consequence of a long-running legal dispute between the landlord and local government complicating preservation efforts. View Image Details A closer look at the facade. The circular outline of where the original sign would have been mounted is visible. You may also notice a moth in the frame; there were hundreds flying all around the building when I visited. The characters emblazoned on the front of the building read Zhōngshān Hall 中山堂 1 but this was not the original name. If you look closely at the photograph you can see a circular outline around the central character, almost certainly where something would have been mounted. I strongly suspect this would have been a plate inscribed with the Ershui city emblem (shìhuī 市徽), a convention outlined in a previous post about the nearby Fenyuan Town Hall . I went looking for archival footage of the hall but found nothing online to confirm this hunch. One of the benefits of conferring heritage status on a building is that at least some amount of proper research will be done—but in this case all I’ve got to go on is the work of Taiwanese bloggers also interested in local history and culture. View Image Details Creeping around the side of the derelict assembly hall. The assembly hall 2 was constructed between the older, unplanned Qing dynasty era settlement and the newer, more modern area around Ershui Station 二水車站 , which opened in 1905. This reflects a common urban planning pattern in the Japanese colonial era: grafting an area of wider streets (often on a grid) and institutional buildings ( e.g. post offices, police stations, government offices, etc.) onto an existing town 3 . As expected, the old assembly hall was constructed next to an assortment of other civic buildings, among them a police station and several wooden dormitories. Google Street View records indicate the police station was still present in 2012—so the unkempt meadowland immediately adjacent to the assembly hall has only been empty for a few years. View Image Details The side door is open for some reason, how could I not go take a look? I didn’t expect to be able to take a peek inside the old assembly hall, particularly not after jumping the fence around the side and arousing the attention of two Taiwanese men playing catch on a bare patch of ground next to the fire station, which is still in use. I put on a smile and asked if it was alright to go take a look and, after glancing at one another, the man closer to me assented with a curt nod. Stepping through the weeds, I went around back and had a look inside the assembly hall and a small wooden building with a surprisingly interesting history. View Image Details Inside the assembly hall. It doesn’t look so bad in here. View Image Details Evidently it is now used as storage by the fire department. Unbeknownst to me at the time, the wooden building behind the assembly hall originally served as an office of the Hoko system 保甲制度 , a grassroots form of civic self-governance and law enforcement adapted from the existing Baojia system . This system provided an interface between community leaders and law enforcement—which is why this old wooden building was located next to the colonial era police station. Community leaders under the Hoko system were charged with registering overnight visitors, reporting suspicious activity, and other such duties. The Hoko system was also used to reshape social customs in the early Japanese colonial period. Foot binding , a common practice in late 19th century Taiwan , was viewed by the Japanese as an uncivilized custom—and rightly so. Seeking to discourage and then outright ban the practice in the 1910s, the Japanese sent orders down through the network of Hoko offices to identify households with bound women and eventually order their unbinding 4 . View Image Details The old Hoko Office 保甲事務所 in Ershui. View Image Details Inside the old office, which was obviously repurposed since 1945. Visually there is nothing too interesting about the Hoko Office 保甲事務所, nor was there much of anything left inside. This system was abolished in 1945, not long before the beginning of the housing crisis that coincided with the KMT defeat in China , so there’s a good chance it was someone’s residence in the intervening years. Then again, it might have continued to serve another institutional function. Had I not read about it here I would have assumed it was just another police dormitory. The only thing that really stands out is the base of a flagpole constructed in the same rugged pebble-washed style (xǐshízǐ 洗石子) as the assembly hall.

Media reports often describe it as the Linkou Monster House (林口怪怪屋) and it regularly appears alongside the Longtan Monster House and other examples of the genre.

No formal name seems to exist and I’ve uncovered no government records. I am loathe to base a post on rumours and hearsay but in this case that’s about all I have. From the comments on this post it sounds like the building has been abandoned for at least a decade and maybe two. One respondent suggests it was damaged during an earthquake—but I have my doubts.

Recently I added yet another theater to my growing catalogue of old school cinemas in Taiwan : the derelict Dōng’ān Grand Theater 東安大戲院 in East Tainan. This theater opened in 1969 and closed its doors not long after the turn of the millennium, another victim of changing consumer habits.

Today I went to investigate reports of an abandoned building on the edge of Xīméndīng (西門町), a busy commercial district in central Taipei . It is fairly well-known due to its central location but I could find no easy means of entry for the very same reasons. From this television news report it sounds as if this was originally the Zhōngwài Department Store Company (中外百貨公司) and later the Yángyáng Department Store (洋洋百貨). While it isn’t surprising to find such ruins around much of Taiwan it is somewhat unusual to see in such a prosperous area. The building is for rent, as I understand it, and much of the aforementioned report seems concerned with the outrageous price tag for such a decaying monstrosity. View Image Details The grotty facade of an abandoned department store in downtown Taipei. View Image Details Shattered window tessellations. This department store was not among the more famous of the many malls of Ximending, Taipei’s most vital and important shopping district for much of the 20th century, so I haven’t unearthed much about it. Ordinarily when I scope out a ruin like this I am interested in when it was built, when and why it was abandoned, and what might happen to it in the near-future. In this case I don’t feel as if I am working from reliable source material—Taiwanese media aren’t exactly known for historical accuracy and attention to detail. The only corroborating evidence I’ve turned up is this video from 1972, in which Zhongwai Department Store makes an appearance around the 4:25 mark. Obviously the building has been renovated since then—the ugly windows appear nowhere in the archival footage in either video. View Image Details A dark and moldy place illuminated by the lights of the street. View Image Details Beauty salons on the upper levels. View Image Details Dark, hot, and moldy corridors. View Image Details New life takes hold on one of the upper levels of the old department store. Originally I published this post with only a few shots of the exterior. A few weeks later I was on my way to dinner in Ximending when I thought to at least take another look at the entrance to see if there might be an easier way to slip inside by night—and there was!

It was terribly hot and humid inside with very little ventilation and the stench of mold hanging in the stagnant air. Only the rooftop provided a reprieve—and it was here that I captured one of the more interesting views of this minor ruin in the bustling heart of Taipei.

Despite having spent a lot of time in Yuanlin , a mid-sized city in central Changhua , Taiwan , I have only recently begun to explore some of its more famous ruins. Among these is Yuanlin Hospital 員林醫院, formally the Changhua County Yuanlin Hospital 彰化縣立員林醫院, originally built in 1963 and operational until the the turn of the millennium. Nowadays it is one of the more notorious abandoned places in central Taiwan, where it is regularly featured in news reports, particularly around Ghost Month 鬼月 . Taiwanese media engage in an annual outpouring of overly sensationalized stories about haunted places—and hospitals , as liminal spaces of birth and death, often appear in such reports, complicating research into the real story of what went on. View Image Details Deep afternoon at an infamous abandoned hospital in Yuanlin, Taiwan. View Image Details At the entrance to the old hospital. Some effort has been undertaken to seal the building but this was obviously undone long ago. Notoriety is a curse for urban explorers interested in experiencing a genuine sense of what a place was like before it was abandoned to the elements. Yuanlin Hospital is far from unspoiled—almost everything of value and interest has been stripped out of the interior and the walls are covered with adolescent graffiti (most of which has been carefully cropped out of my photos). View Image Details This scene is the first thing you’ll see when you step inside the lobby. Although this hospital is located on the edge of town it is immediately adjacent to a busy schoolyard—and you can be sure that kids regularly dare one another to enter the “haunted” hospital, play pranks, and spread rumours. Some half-hearted effort was undertaken to seal the building long ago but it is now effortless to walk inside if you know the location. Bizarrely, several news reports I’ve perused openly list the address of the hospital, inviting members of the public to take a look for themselves. Yuanlin Hospital is far from secret but it is not without a certain vintage charm. View Image Details On the left side of the lobby is a counter with the phrase “wishing you a quick recovery” ( 祝早日康復 ) emblazoned overhead. View Image Details Is medical imaging right for you? View Image Details Clean and happy toothpaste 快樂潔牙營 . View Image Details Ascending to the upper levels of the abandoned Yuanlin Hospital. View Image Details A lone chair on the sheltered rooftop of the ruined hospital. Playground sounds from the school next door made this place much less creepy than it looks in pictures. Minor misgivings aside, Yuanlin Hospital is a fine example of the institutional aesthetics of the KMT authoritarian era , all reinforced concrete, angular ironwork, and patterned tile. The teal paint running along the corridors should be familiar to anyone who has visited any of the nation’s historic military villages. You might not feel like you’re the first person to set foot in this place in years but it’s still worth a visit if you’re interested in urban exploration in Taiwan . View Image Details Roots invade the old hospital. View Image Details Rusty ironwork on the third floor of the hospital. View Image Details Coming down from the top floor. View Image Details Stalking the deserted corridors of Yuanlin Hospital. As for what really happened here, it sounds like this hospital was doomed by government inefficiency rather than anything sordid like medical malpractice or embezzlement. From what I understand the hospital was originally owned and operated by the Changhua County Health Bureau 彰化縣衛生局 . After it was closed property rights were transferred to what is now the city of Yuanlin, and I suppose they’ve just taken their sweet time getting around to redeveloping the site. Recent news reports suggest it will be turned into an activity center some day. View Image Details Light seeps in from the back of the hospital. There were many rooms just like this one stripped of almost anything of interest. View Image Details Infectious disease protocol. View Image Details Hand washing station. View Image Details Mud-speckled walls on the back side of the hospital. Heavy rain or run-off from the roof is likely the cause of this unusual pattern. View Image Details Tortured window blinds coiled around a column. This hospital has endured exposure to all manner of typhoons over the years. View Image Details The former operating room devoid of almost anything of interest. There was a small observation window on the other side, unseen in this photograph. View Image Details Discarded latex glove and broken glass. View Image Details Nothing much left in the office. View Image Details Medical waste. View Image Details Where the teal paint came from. View Image Details Vintage no smoking sign in the hallway. View Image Details Ghost in an exposed mirror on the balcony. View Image Details Sunlight seeping into the X-ray room. View Image Details Entrance to the X-ray chamber (X 光室 ). I’m guessing the characters below are probably the name of a doctor or technician, Lài Qīnrén 賴欽仁 . View Image Details Inside the mosquito-infested X-ray room. There were some interesting artifacts inside the back room but it wasn’t pleasant being there. View Image Details Blue scrubs at Yuanlin Hospital. The logo is composed of six characters: 縣立員林醫院 . In a curious coincidence Yuanlin Hospital has been in the news since I visited earlier this month. Police received panicked reports about someone hanging themselves inside the hospital only weeks after I was there—and in Changhua suicide by hanging is an extremely serious issue, necessitating a unique purification ritual known in Taiwanese as sàng bah-tsàng 送肉粽 (see my post about Daodong Academy 道東書院 in nearby Hemei for more about this practice). View Image Details Downstairs at the dispensary. Please wait until your number is called… Luckily there was no hanging — it was a prop from the filming of an episode of the television drama series Love, Timeless 鐘樓愛人 . The crew had left a dummy hanging in the hallway and a concerned parent had seen it while walking their kid to school. This strikes me as being rather irresponsible given local beliefs about hanging—but whatever, the news media ate it up. View Image Details Around the bend at Yuanlin Hospital. This corridor runs along the side of the L-shaped building. View Image Details Dead end on the ground floor. Directly opposite this exit is a busy schoolyard. View Image Details Oh, what have we here? View Image Details A cramped look at the abandoned ambulance. View Image Details One last look at Yuanlin Hospital. Don’t expect this to last; the government is planning to build an activity center here in the near future… For more about Yuanlin Hospital some Taiwanese bloggers have written accounts here (with more photos here ) and here (continued in part two here ). I also found another post with some great photos that you might like if you were expecting something spooky. A Japanese blogger also wrote about it .

Despite having spent a lot of time in Yuanlin , a mid-sized city in central Changhua , Taiwan , I have only recently begun to explore some of its more famous ruins. Among these is Yuanlin Hospital 員林醫院, formally the Changhua County Yuanlin Hospital 彰化縣立員林醫院, originally built in 1963 and operational until the the turn of the millennium. Nowadays it is one of the more notorious abandoned places in central Taiwan, where it is regularly featured in news reports, particularly around Ghost Month 鬼月 . Taiwanese media engage in an annual outpouring of overly sensationalized stories about haunted places—and hospitals , as liminal spaces of birth and death, often appear in such reports, complicating research into the real story of what went on. View Image Details Deep afternoon at an infamous abandoned hospital in Yuanlin, Taiwan. View Image Details At the entrance to the old hospital. Some effort has been undertaken to seal the building but this was obviously undone long ago. Notoriety is a curse for urban explorers interested in experiencing a genuine sense of what a place was like before it was abandoned to the elements. Yuanlin Hospital is far from unspoiled—almost everything of value and interest has been stripped out of the interior and the walls are covered with adolescent graffiti (most of which has been carefully cropped out of my photos). View Image Details This scene is the first thing you’ll see when you step inside the lobby. Although this hospital is located on the edge of town it is immediately adjacent to a busy schoolyard—and you can be sure that kids regularly dare one another to enter the “haunted” hospital, play pranks, and spread rumours. Some half-hearted effort was undertaken to seal the building long ago but it is now effortless to walk inside if you know the location. Bizarrely, several news reports I’ve perused openly list the address of the hospital, inviting members of the public to take a look for themselves. Yuanlin Hospital is far from secret but it is not without a certain vintage charm. View Image Details On the left side of the lobby is a counter with the phrase “wishing you a quick recovery” ( 祝早日康復 ) emblazoned overhead. View Image Details Is medical imaging right for you? View Image Details Clean and happy toothpaste 快樂潔牙營 . View Image Details Ascending to the upper levels of the abandoned Yuanlin Hospital. View Image Details A lone chair on the sheltered rooftop of the ruined hospital. Playground sounds from the school next door made this place much less creepy than it looks in pictures. Minor misgivings aside, Yuanlin Hospital is a fine example of the institutional aesthetics of the KMT authoritarian era , all reinforced concrete, angular ironwork, and patterned tile. The teal paint running along the corridors should be familiar to anyone who has visited any of the nation’s historic military villages. You might not feel like you’re the first person to set foot in this place in years but it’s still worth a visit if you’re interested in urban exploration in Taiwan . View Image Details Roots invade the old hospital. View Image Details Rusty ironwork on the third floor of the hospital. View Image Details Coming down from the top floor. View Image Details Stalking the deserted corridors of Yuanlin Hospital. As for what really happened here, it sounds like this hospital was doomed by government inefficiency rather than anything sordid like medical malpractice or embezzlement. From what I understand the hospital was originally owned and operated by the Changhua County Health Bureau 彰化縣衛生局 . After it was closed property rights were transferred to what is now the city of Yuanlin, and I suppose they’ve just taken their sweet time getting around to redeveloping the site. Recent news reports suggest it will be turned into an activity center some day. View Image Details Light seeps in from the back of the hospital. There were many rooms just like this one stripped of almost anything of interest. View Image Details Infectious disease protocol. View Image Details Hand washing station. View Image Details Mud-speckled walls on the back side of the hospital. Heavy rain or run-off from the roof is likely the cause of this unusual pattern. View Image Details Tortured window blinds coiled around a column. This hospital has endured exposure to all manner of typhoons over the years. View Image Details The former operating room devoid of almost anything of interest. There was a small observation window on the other side, unseen in this photograph. View Image Details Discarded latex glove and broken glass. View Image Details Nothing much left in the office. View Image Details Medical waste. View Image Details Where the teal paint came from. View Image Details Vintage no smoking sign in the hallway. View Image Details Ghost in an exposed mirror on the balcony. View Image Details Sunlight seeping into the X-ray room. View Image Details Entrance to the X-ray chamber (X 光室 ). I’m guessing the characters below are probably the name of a doctor or technician, Lài Qīnrén 賴欽仁 . View Image Details Inside the mosquito-infested X-ray room. There were some interesting artifacts inside the back room but it wasn’t pleasant being there. View Image Details Blue scrubs at Yuanlin Hospital. The logo is composed of six characters: 縣立員林醫院 . In a curious coincidence Yuanlin Hospital has been in the news since I visited earlier this month. Police received panicked reports about someone hanging themselves inside the hospital only weeks after I was there—and in Changhua suicide by hanging is an extremely serious issue, necessitating a unique purification ritual known in Taiwanese as sàng bah-tsàng 送肉粽 (see my post about Daodong Academy 道東書院 in nearby Hemei for more about this practice). View Image Details Downstairs at the dispensary. Please wait until your number is called… Luckily there was no hanging — it was a prop from the filming of an episode of the television drama series Love, Timeless 鐘樓愛人 . The crew had left a dummy hanging in the hallway and a concerned parent had seen it while walking their kid to school. This strikes me as being rather irresponsible given local beliefs about hanging—but whatever, the news media ate it up. View Image Details Around the bend at Yuanlin Hospital. This corridor runs along the side of the L-shaped building. View Image Details Dead end on the ground floor. Directly opposite this exit is a busy schoolyard. View Image Details Oh, what have we here? View Image Details A cramped look at the abandoned ambulance. View Image Details One last look at Yuanlin Hospital. Don’t expect this to last; the government is planning to build an activity center here in the near future… For more about Yuanlin Hospital some Taiwanese bloggers have written accounts here (with more photos here ) and here (continued in part two here ). I also found another post with some great photos that you might like if you were expecting something spooky. A Japanese blogger also wrote about it .

View Image Details The view from within a decaying public housing block in downtown Taipei. Yesterday I followed a lead to Lánzhōu Public Housing (蘭州國宅), a KMT authoritarian era project in central Datong , Taipei . It is similar to Nanjichang Community (南機場社區), a far more well-known housing project in Wanhua , but this building was constructed almost ten years later in 1973. As with Nanjichang, its fate also remains unclear, as the city is working through complex land ownership issues to figure out how to move residents into more modern housing. I plan to have a full write-up about this place some day so I’ll leave it at that for now—just a glimpse.

Intramuros (literally “within the walls”) is the former center of Spanish colonial power and the Catholic Church in the Philippines . Located in the heart of old Manila , this fortified district has a long and complicated history stretching back more than four centuries, but little of what remains is original and untouched. Intramuros was heavily damaged during the Japanese invasion in 1941 and almost completely destroyed in the Battle of Manila in 1945. Almost everything seen in my photos was reconstructed beginning in the 1950s and continuing to the present day. View Image Details The southern entrance to Intramuros, Manila. View Image Details This watchtower now overlooks a golf course rather than the double moat of colonial times. View Image Details Watch out for flying golf balls: little effort is made to retain an authentic feeling along the walls. View Image Details Intramuros is home to a patchwork of buildings, some old and historic, and others less so. View Image Details The Seamen’s Hospital , located near the southern entrance to Intramuros. View Image Details Manila Bulletin and the outer walls of Intramuros. The newspaper is located on land formerly occupied by the San Nicolas de Tolentino Church, another precious piece of Filipino heritage lost in the war. View Image Details Under construction in Intramuros. I went to take a closer look but was waved away by an angry old man. I captured these photos on a long day of exploration during my first trip to Manila in November 2015. I started with a brief stop at the ruins of Paco Railway Station before enjoying an excellent brunch buffet at the Bayleaf Hotel in Intramuros. Fully sated, I spent a couple of hours aimlessly wandering around the old walled city and attached fort before breezing by the Aduana Building on my way to the historic Manila Metropolitan Theater . Finally I crossed the Pasig River into Binondo , Santa Cruz , and Quiapo , primarily to scope out Art Deco architecture around the old downtown core. Whereas my work in Taiwan is informed by years of experience these photos were all shot on my first day of poking around the more historic parts of Manila and, since I am nowhere near as knowledgeable about what I captured, I’ll mostly let the photos speak for themselves. View Image Details San Agustin Church, the only major landmark still standing in Intramuros after the liberation of Manila in 1945. View Image Details One of several ornate entrances to San Agustin. Notice the two Chinese-style guardian lions on either side of the doorway? View Image Details Guardians of the sacred portal. View Image Details A broken stone lion in front of San Agustin. View Image Details One of the side doors at San Agustin Church. San Agustin Church is the only major landmark to survive the liberation of Manila in 1945 (for reference, check out this incredible aerial photo of Intramuros in 1945 ; the church can be seen at top right). The first church in Manila (and indeed, on the entire island of Luzon was founded on this site in 1571 but it wasn’t until 1607 that a stone church was constructed and consecrated here. The original structure has survived numerous earthquakes and wars and has been renovated and restored numerous times over the centuries. More recently it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site , one of only a handful of Baroque churches in the Philippines to receive such recognition. I knew nothing of this when I wandered by to shoot a few photos of the exterior otherwise I would have paid admission and stepped inside to check it out. Just about the only interesting thing I can point out in my own photos is the presence of several Chinese-style guardian lions donated by Catholic Chinese. If you’re curious about the history of this church I recommend checking out this great article full of archival photos. View Image Details The reconstructed Manila Cathedral in the center of Intramuros. View Image Details Eye in the pyramid on a door at the Old Manila Cathedral. View Image Details A statue inside the famous Manila Cathedral. View Image Details A solemn atmosphere inside the Manila Cathedral. Intramuros was formerly home to seven churches but apart from the aforementioned San Agustin Church all were destroyed in the war. Of the remaining six, five were rebuilt elsewhere in Manila. Only the eponymous Manila Cathedral , rebuilt in 1958, is located on its original site, in front of the Plaza de Roma . Formally known as the Minor Basilica of the Immaculate Conception, it was also destroyed and rebuilt numerous times over the centuries, mostly by devastating earthquakes. From what I’ve read this is the eighth church built on this site , which seems quite incredible to me. This time around I did step inside to take a look around, though I must admit that I don’t know very much about Catholic architecture or religious imagery and didn’t notice anything extraordinary. View Image Details Archway detail from the eighth church built on this site. View Image Details Max’s abandoned restaurant on the way to the old fort. View Image Details Crossing the moat into Fort Santiago. Fort Santiago is located on the edge of Intramuros at the mouth of the Pasig River . It also dates back to the late 16th century and has undergone centuries of destruction, modification, and renewal. As with most of the rest of Intramuros it was heavily damaged in the war and the famous gate is entirely reconstructed. Apart from serving a defensive function it was also a notorious prison in colonial times and again during the war. José Rizal , a national hero, was executed here in 1896, and a former barracks now houses the Rizal Shrine , a small museum documenting his life and death . View Image Details A closer look at the gateway to Fort Santiago, adorned with an image of Saint James . View Image Details The ruins of what was apparently an old theater within the courtyard of Fort Santiago. View Image Details Remnants of the past inside the Fort Santiago compound. I’m not too sure what this structure once was. View Image Details Peering out from the dungeons of Fort Santiago. Allied POWs were imprisoned here during the war and hundreds perished due to inhumane conditions. View Image Details This antique clock inside the Rizal Shrine notes the moment of his execution: five past seven in the morning of December 30th, 1896. View Image Details An old watchtower by the Pasig River. View Image Details Taking a stroll along a poorly maintained walkway running along the Pasig River just outside the walls of Fort Santiago. Most of Intramuros may be as ersatz as Gyeongbokgung in Seoul but there is no escaping the weight of history that pervades the humid tropical air within these walls. Now having done a little more reading into what I saw that day I can appreciate the immense challenge of recreating an entire city transformed into dust by an immense battle that claimed the lives of more than 100,000 souls. View Image Details Intramuros from the rooftop of the Bayleaf Hotel. The Manila Cathedral can be seen just left of center and the San Agustin Church is also visible further to the left. Following this brief walkabout within the walls I exited to the north and chanced upon the ruins of the Aduana Building , which I wrote an entire post about, before continuing to the Manila Metropolitan Theater .

View Image Details Time and the elements have weathered this transformer box on the streets of Linkou. Yesterday I went on a short tour of Linkou inspired by the opening of the Taoyuan Airport MRT and the proliferation of YouBike stations to the exurbs of Taipei . After spending some time under the sun I stopped to pick up some water at one of Taiwan’s ubiquitous convenience stores and noticed a weathered padmount transformer out front, pictured here. It may be hard to make out but the blue logo is that of the state-owned Taiwan Power Company 台灣電力公司 (pinyin: Táiwān Diànlì Gōngsī ), or merely Taipower 台電 for short. This logo has an interesting history dating back to the early Japanese colonial era —an earlier iteration graces the ruins of the Guishan Power Plant 龜山發電廠 , built in 1905—but this particular version was designed in 1947. It may be difficult to discern in this picture but the logo consists of the characters for Taipower surrounded by red bolts of electricity, all enclosed by three circles, a motif that can be seen on other state-owned enterprises such as the Taiwan Sugar Corporation . Incidentally, this particular transformer is located in the vicinity of the former Shu Lin Kou Air Station 樹林口通訊站 (1955–1977), itself built on a Japanese World War II airbase. No trace of this former American SIGINT facility but you’ll find a treasure trove of old photos and videos on this vintage web site .

South Yuanlin Station 南員林站 is an abandoned Japanese colonial era railway station located not far from the newly reopened Yuanlin Station 員林車站 in the heart of Yuanlin , a mid-sized city in central Changhua . It opened in 1933 as a small stop on the now-derelict Yuanlin Line 員林線 of the Taiwan Sugar Railways 臺灣糖業鐵路 , which ran due west across the Changhua Plain 彰化平原 for approximately 9 kilometers to the Xihu Sugar Factory 溪湖糖廠 in Xihu . Apart from facilitating the transport of sugarcane and other cargo this old wooden station also provided passenger service until it was abolished sometime around 1976. View Image Details An old wooden railway station in back alley Yuanlin. The sign reads “yield before the main road” ( 讓前有幹道 ). View Image Details This small station was in service for more than 40 years and has been abandoned for about as long. The railway curving through this part of town was built in 1919, predating the construction of the station by more than a decade. The sugar rail network ran on a narrow-gauge of 762 mm that was later supplanted with a third rail to accommodate traffic crossing over from the standard 1,067 mm gauge of the Taiwan Railway Administration 臺灣鐵路管理局 (which is, incidentally, also the standard for rail transport in Japan ). This dual-gauge system has been paved over in the vicinity of the station but much of it can still be seen moving west along the modest rail trail extending west to the outskirts of town. View Image Details Railroad switches in front of the old station. Both still move! There would be little to indicate the original function of the old wooden station were it not for a rusty pair of railroad switches out front. Years ago there was also a water tower—the original sugar rail trains were propelled by steam engines—and concrete station platform, but all that has been removed to create a small parking lot for local residents. I am not aware of any specific measures to preserve or recognize the station as a heritage building so its fate is anyone’s guess. View Image Details A peek inside the interior of the old station. Not much to see here; obviously it has been used only for storage for quite some time now. Despite having visited Yuanlin dozens of times I didn’t learn of this station’s existence until perusing Chinese language blogs about the sugar rail system. As such, I am indebted to posts such as those here , here , here , and here in authoring this short piece.

View Image Details Ominous skies over the hollow shell of the Aduana Building just outside the walls of Intramuros in Manila. The Aduana Building , also known as the Intendencia, is located just outside the walls of Intramuros , the historic center of Spanish colonial Manila . Originally built as a customs house in the 1820s, it has undergone several cycles of destruction and renewal starting in 1863, when the building was almost completely destroyed by the same strong earthquake that leveled much of the old city. Rebuilt in the mid-1870s, it served various government functions—office of the National Archives , first home of the Philippines Senate , and again the Bureau of Customs —before it was ravaged during the initial and final bombing campaigns of World War II . After reconstruction it again served as the offices of different government agencies before it was finally abandoned following a devastating fire in 1979. Restoration plans have been floated since the 1990s but as of late 2015, when I wandered by, the Aduana Building remains in ruin. View Image Details A peek inside the interior of the Aduana Building.

Fenyuan Town Hall ( 芬園庄役場 ) is another example of neglected Japanese colonial era architecture in Taiwan . Built in 1935, this modest building was the administrative center of the village of Fenyuan , located on the eastern edge of Changhua back when it was part of Taichū Prefecture (臺中州). It survived the war and remained in use until 1994 when a newer town hall was built down the street. Art Deco flourishes and the rust-colored emblem over the entrance give Fenyuan’s old town hall a distinctive look.

The angular glyph above the entrance is an intriguing example of a city emblem (市徽) based on a Chinese character (“芬”, the first in the district’s name, in this case).

The decorative end tiles at each corner of the rooftop deserve a little attention. Such end tiles are a common feature of East Asian design and typically serve practical ( i.e. leak prevention), auspicious, and aesthetic functions. Puzzling out exactly what term to use for these architectural features was not at all obvious. Several sources I consulted refer to what the Japanese call onigawara (鬼瓦, literally “ogre” or “demon” tile), but this term is specific to end tiles decorated with monstrous patterns designed to ward off evil 2 . A less ostentatious term might be hanakawara ( 花瓦 ), literally “floral tile”, which feels more appropriate given that this town hall is decorated with a peach motif, but this does not appear to be in common use in Taiwan. Perhaps the most accurate term for these decorative features is wǎzhèn ( 瓦鎮 , literally “tile guard”), or something along those lines. In some sense these end tiles can be seen as a fusion between the “horseback” gables of Qing Taiwan, traditional Japanese architecture, and the new building materials and modernist influences prevalent at the time the town hall was built.

Fenyuan Town Hall ( 芬園庄役場 ) is another example of neglected Japanese colonial era architecture in Taiwan . Built in 1935, this modest building was the administrative center of the village of Fenyuan , located on the eastern edge of Changhua back when it was part of Taichū Prefecture (臺中州). It survived the war and remained in use until 1994 when a newer town hall was built down the street. Art Deco flourishes and the rust-colored emblem over the entrance give Fenyuan’s old town hall a distinctive look. Nowadays it is derelict—but it seems likely that it will be restored and opened to the public some day. View Image Details Fenyuan’s abandoned town hall from Japanese times.

View Image Details Just a parking garage. Cǎoxiédūn Public Parkade 草鞋墩公有立體停車場 is an intimidating structure looming over one of the main commercial shopping streets in Caotun , Taiwan . I was there in search of an abandoned theater but was immediately impressed with the strikingly brutalist design of this multi-storey car park . It is merely a place to park so there’s little more to say, though it would seem that it was recently derelict . Probably the only other tidbit of information worth conveying is that “Caoxiedun” refers to the original name of the town. You can be sure the first settlers never imagined this monument to honest architecture standing in their newly sown fields.
